# SHAPE — Design Record (Historical)

> **Status (2026-07-11): promoted.** The ACIF 0.1 specification set under
> `specs/` supersedes this document for all promoted content — where this
> record and a spec disagree, the spec governs. SHAPE remains the decision
> history (Decisions #1–#34, the OQ ledger, panel back-references) and is
> retained unmodified except for the spec-promotion ratifications recorded
> inline and in the "Spec-Promotion Ratifications" section at the end.
> Do not extend this file; new design work amends the specs.

## Common Envelope

Fields shared by all content types. Present in every manifest regardless of `kind`.

```yaml
kind: hook | skill | rule | command | agent | mcp_config | pack  # required
id: "f47ac10b-58cc-4372-a567-0e02b2c3d479"               # required — UUID v4, generated once, never changes
display_name: "Session Start: Inject Prompt"             # required — human-readable, for display only
version: "5.1.0"                                         # OPTIONAL — literal-or-absent. When declared, MUST be valid SemVer 2.0.0 (Decision #20). NO inheritance (Decision #16). Pack version lives on the pack record only.
description: "Injects system context at session start."  # optional
license:                                                 # optional
  spdx: MIT                                              # required if license block present
  file: LICENSE                                          # optional — relative path in repo
  url: https://example.com/license.txt                  # optional — absolute URL (for externally hosted)
pack_id: "a1b2c3d4-..."                                  # OPTIONAL — UUIDv4 publisher-declared pack membership. See Decision #18. Lives in publisher_section.
```

**Forbidden item fields** (Decision #16, enforceable by lint): `effective_version`, `derived_version`, `pack_inherited_version`, `resolved_version`. The presence of any of these on an item record is a conformance error.

## Carrier Rules

Sidecars are the universal primary artifact for every content type. Frontmatter is an optional supplementary layer for content types that support it.

| Content type | Primary carrier | Publisher frontmatter |
|---|---|---|
| hook, mcp_config | Sidecar file (always generated) | Not possible — harness owns `settings.json`/`mcp.json`; no inline surface exists |
| skill, rule, agent, command | Sidecar file (always generated) | Opt-in — hand-authored or CI-populated alongside the sidecar |

**Data flows sidecar → frontmatter, never the reverse.** The frontmatter CI reads the canonical sidecar and projects its values into the source file. Frontmatter is intentionally redundant with the sidecar; that redundancy serves portability (a copied file carries its own metadata).

For sidecars, `kind` is required — the file has no implicit type.
For frontmatter, `kind` is optional (inferred from the canonical filename, e.g., `SKILL.md` → `kind: skill`).

## Hook Extension Block

Appended below the common envelope when `kind: hook`.

```yaml
hook:
  event: session_start          # required — canonical event name (Appendix C.2); distinct from display_name

  matcher: ""                   # optional — event-occurrence filter (e.g., tool names for tool
                                # events); canonical tool names component-wise (Appendix C.1).
                                # Absent in canonical form when empty. [Unified at spec promotion:
                                # the D_K matcher_patterns predicate reads this field.]

  handlers:                     # required, ≥1 — typed handlers per Appendix C.3; order significant
                                # (execution order). Absent/empty → acif.hook.handlers_missing.

                                # command handler as its entrypoint carrier. See [ACIF-HOOK] §6.3.]
    - type: command             # {command, http, prompt, agent}; absent → command materialized
      scripts:                  # required for type: command — OS-variants of ONE logical

                                # os ABSENT = unconstrained default (matches all — OQ-6 resolved);
                                # os: [] is an authoring error (rejected). ≤1 default entry; no OS
                                # may be matched by two constrained entries (disjointness — rejects
                                # acif.hook.script_default_ambiguous / script_platform_ambiguous).
                                # Selection: constrained-beats-default; no match = defined no-op.
                                # arch is advisory in v0.1 (not in selection). The canonical wiring
                                # here is INSIDE the body_hash preimage (Decision #19 as amended).
        - type: file
          path: hooks/session-start-inject-prompt
          os: [darwin, linux]   # optional — omit if OS-agnostic

                                # Of nine Syllago canonical hook capability keys, three are
                                # DERIVABLE via per-key D_K predicates (handler_types over
                                # Hooks[*].Type with closed enum {command, http, prompt, agent}
                                # pinned per Decision #29; matcher_patterns over Matcher with

                                # json_io_protocol / context_injection / permission_control (all
                                # under script-body opacity — capability semantics live in script
                                # body bytes that the canonical wiring carries opaquely).
                                # Runtime hints (python, node, powershell) deferred to roadmap.
                                # See panel/hooks-requires-consensus.md.

    skill:
      id: "550e8400-..."        # required — item UUIDv4 of the target skill; load-bearing cross-reference key
      name: "tdd-workflow"      # optional — human-readable advisory only; renames don't break the UUID reference
```

## Skill Extension Block

Appended below the common envelope when `kind: skill`.

```yaml
skill:
  activation:                   # optional — defaults MATERIALIZED at canonicalization (Decision #21,
                                # as amended): type: auto and user_invocable: true when absent.
                                # Validators MUST NOT re-apply defaults (parallel to Decision #24).
                                # Hash home ratified at spec promotion ([ACIF-CORE] §7.8): declared
                                # activation values ride metadata_hash over the faithfully-observed
                                # publisher_section; materialized defaults enter NO hash preimage;
                                # the block never enters body_hash (frontmatter-bearing type).
    type: manual | auto | hook  # required when activation block present
                                # manual: user explicitly invokes (e.g., /skillname)
                                # auto:   model decides based on description (current default behavior)
                                # hook:   a hook makes the activation decision; see activation_target on hook side
    user_invocable: true        # OPTIONAL — default true; orthogonal to type (Decision #21 amendment).
                                # false removes the skill from user-invocation surfaces (e.g., /menus)
                                # without affecting model invocation. The post-materialization
                                # resolves-to-false state is the installer-side filtering signal.
    hook_ref:                   # OPTIONAL even when type: hook (Decision #21's normative text
                                # governs; ratified at spec promotion — [ACIF-SKILL] §6.3, the

                                # manual/auto (acif.skill.hook_ref_forbidden)
      id: "f47ac10b-..."        # required when hook_ref present — item UUIDv4 of the activating
                                # hook (absent id → acif.skill.hook_ref_id_missing)
      name: "skill-activator"   # optional — human-readable advisory only

  requires: {}                  # OPTIONAL — empty/absent for v0.1 (Decision #23).
                                # Of fifteen Syllago canonical skill capability keys, four are
                                # DERIVABLE via per-key D_K predicates — auto_invocable,
                                # disable_model_invocation, and user_invocable (all over the
                                # post-materialization activation block), plus
                                # skill_bundled_resources (via Decision #19's single/multi-file
                                # classification predicate, exclusion-list form). Eleven are
                                # OUT-OF-SCOPE-AT-L1: five meta-property (display_name,
                                # description, license, compatibility, metadata_map), one
                                # common-envelope (version), three install-location
                                # (project/global/shared scope → install_scope_capabilities),
                                # two discovery (canonical_filename, custom_filename —
                                # Decision #22). Latent SkillMeta fields (allowed-tools /
                                # model / bundled hooks) are OQ-10 candidates, not requires keys.
                                # See panel/skills-requires-consensus.md.
```

**Canonical truth for hook → skill activation lives on the hook** (`activation_target`). The skill's `activation.type: hook` is a discovery convenience; the `hook_ref` on the skill is optional (the registry can resolve the reverse mapping from hook records).

**Skill discovery** (Decision #22): publishers SHOULD ship skills as `SKILL.md` inside a skill-named directory. Three discovery tiers apply:

1. **Publisher-declared** — pack manifest declares `skill_paths: ["./skills/", "./advanced/"]`. Registry uses these.
2. **Heuristic + filename fallback** — registry scans known dirs; accepts `SKILL.md` (canonical), `*.md` with `kind: skill` frontmatter (heuristic), or bare `.md` with filename → `name` (fallback).
3. **Non-conformant** — arbitrary layouts with no manifest and no frontmatter are out of scope; publisher must conform.

## Rule Extension Block

Appended below the common envelope when `kind: rule`.

```yaml
rule:
  activation:                   # optional — default MATERIALIZED at canonicalization (Decision #30):
                                # mode: always when the block is absent. Validators MUST NOT
                                # re-apply defaults (parallel to Decisions #24/#21). Hash home
                                # ratified at spec promotion ([ACIF-CORE] §7.8): declared mode/globs
                                # ride metadata_hash; the materialized default enters NO hash
                                # preimage; the block never enters body_hash.
    mode: always | glob | model_decision | manual
                                # required when activation block present — Decision #30 closed enum
                                # (ACIF-originated vocabulary; block present without mode →
                                # acif.rule.activation_mode_missing; unknown/whitespace value →
                                # acif.rule.activation_mode_invalid; exact byte match, no trim/fold)
    globs: ["src/**/*.ts"]      # required iff mode: glob (else acif.rule.glob_mode_without_globs);
                                # forbidden otherwise (acif.rule.globs_without_glob_mode)

  requires: {}                  # OPTIONAL — empty/absent for v0.1 (Decision #23).
                                # Of five Syllago canonical rule capability keys, one is DERIVABLE
                                # (activation_mode via D_K: activation.mode ∈ {glob, model_decision,
                                # manual}, positive-set form, post-materialization). Four are
                                # OUT-OF-SCOPE-AT-L1: file_imports (prose-body opacity; the
                                # strongest requires-candidate the OQ-7 walks surfaced — rejected
                                # 2:2→Holden under the out-of-band guardrail; coupled to unified
                                # OQ-8, becomes DERIVABLE if a reference grammar is ever pinned),
                                # cross_provider_recognition (provider-side format recognition),
                                # auto_memory (provider-runtime feature), hierarchical_loading
                                # (provider-matrix fact → provider_capability_coverage projection).
                                # See panel/rules-requires-consensus.md.
```

## Command Extension Block

Appended below the common envelope when `kind: command`. The command's canonical body is the prompt text (frontmatter stripped from `body_hash` per Decision #12 — a `model` re-pin moves `metadata_hash`, not `body_hash`). Argument placeholders in the body are canonicalized per Decision #31.

```yaml
command:
  # Canonical frontmatter surface, carried 1:1 as PASSTHROUGH for round-trip fidelity
  # (transport ≠ promotion: none of these fields is capability vocabulary; values are
  # opaque — no live validation, no canonical enums minted. Promotion questions → OQ-10.
  # Latent-field presence MUST NOT soften the orphan-key reject: requires.model on a
  # command is non-conformant even though the field below exists.)
  allowed_tools: [Read, Edit]     # optional — Decision #25 vocabulary applies ON PROMOTION only
  context: fork                   # optional
  agent: "Explore"                # optional — latent NAME-based cross-type reference (command → agent);
                                  # promotion requires resolving name-vs-UUID (Decision #21/#28) first
  model: "..."                    # optional — provider-specific ID, opaque (no allowlist validation)
  disable_model_invocation: false # optional — OQ-10 uniformity constraint with skills' equivalent
  user_invocable: true            # optional — OQ-10 uniformity constraint with skills' equivalent
  argument_hint: "<pr-number>"    # optional — display-only free text
  effort: "high"                  # optional — provider enum, opaque

  requires: {}                    # OPTIONAL — empty/absent for v0.1 (Decision #23).
                                  # Both Syllago canonical command capability keys are
                                  # OUT-OF-SCOPE-AT-L1: argument_substitution (body-content
                                  # opacity under the derivation-vs-heuristic refinement —
                                  # the $ARGUMENTS token is canonicalizer-normalized, not
                                  # canonicalizer-validated; body piece → advisory token-
                                  # presence projection, provider piece → provider_capability_
                                  # coverage) and builtin_commands (provider-matrix fact;
                                  # HIGH shadowing-severity finding recorded). 0 DERIVABLE /
                                  # 2 OOS-L1 / 0 eligible — OQ-7 closes six-for-six.
                                  # See panel/commands-requires-consensus.md.
```

## Agent Extension Block

Appended below the common envelope when `kind: agent`. **Drafted at spec promotion (2026-07-11, [ACIF-AGENT] §6)** — the design record previously carried the agents-walk dispositions (Decision #23) without a drawn schema; this block is the snake_case form of the canonical fields those dispositions reference.

```yaml
agent:
  tools: [file_read, file_edit, agent]  # optional — allowlist; canonical tool names (Appendix C.1);
                                        # order preserved, entries non-empty; unmapped/MCP-style
                                        # names pass through verbatim
  disallowed_tools: [shell]             # optional — denylist; same discipline
  model: "claude-sonnet-5"              # optional — provider-specific ID, opaque (no allowlist)
  mcp_servers: ["figma"]                # optional — name-declared references to mcp_config items;
                                        # registry-resolved per Decision #28 (declared state exists
                                        # for name-authored refs)
  skills: ["tdd-workflow"]              # optional — name-declared references to skill items
  permission_mode: "..."                # optional — opaque passthrough in v0.1 (enum roadmap)
  background: false                     # optional — opaque passthrough in v0.1

  requires: {}                          # OPTIONAL — empty/absent for v0.1 (Decision #23 agents
                                        # application: 4 DERIVABLE D_K incl. subagent_spawning via
                                        # contains(tools, "agent"); 3 OOS-L1)
```

Hash home ([ACIF-CORE] §7.8): agents are frontmatter-bearing — declared block values (raw provider spellings included) ride `metadata_hash`; the vocabulary-translated canonical form feeds predicates and projections; the body (system-prompt prose) alone feeds `body_hash`.

## Pack Extension Block

Appended below the common envelope when `kind: pack`. Pack records MAY be publisher-declared (authored sidecar at repo root) or registry-inferred (generated from inference algorithm v0.1).

```yaml
kind: pack
id: "f47ac10b-58cc-4372-a567-0e02b2c3d479"   # UUIDv4 if publisher-declared; UUIDv5 if registry-inferred
display_name: "superpowers"                  # required — mutable; not the stable identifier
version: "5.1.0"                             # OPTIONAL — pack's own version. Lives ONLY on the pack record, never propagates to items.
description: "Skills and hooks for AI coding tools"
license:
  spdx: MIT
repository_url: "https://github.com/obra/superpowers"  # required — canonical fetch URL

pack:
  source_kind: declared | inferred           # required — declared (publisher authored) or inferred (registry computed)
  canonical_address: "obra/superpowers"      # required — <owner>/<display_name> form for user-facing URLs
  inference_version: "v0.1"                  # required iff source_kind=inferred — which algorithm produced this record
```

**Pack `items` list lives in `registry_section`, not here.** The items list is OUTPUT of the pack-membership predicate (Decision #18), computed by the registry on every relevant change. Publishers do not author it.

**Pack-membership predicate:**

```
item M ∈ pack P  iff
    M.publisher_section.pack_id == P.id
  OR
    (M.publisher_section.pack_id absent AND M.registry_section.inferred_pack_id == P.id)
```

Declared wins over inferred when both exist and differ.

## MCP Extension Block

Appended below the common envelope when `kind: mcp_config`. The block carries the canonical MCP wiring (server definitions) plus any author-declared non-derivable capabilities in `requires`.

```yaml
mcp:
  servers:                              # required when block has content — map: server name → wiring
    figma:
      command: "npx"                    # stdio transport (mutex with url; see Decision #24)
      args: ["-y", "@figma/mcp-server"]
      env: {FIGMA_TOKEN: "${FIGMA_TOKEN}"}
      type: stdio                       # required in canonical form; materialized at canonicalization (Decision #24)
                                        # permitted values: stdio | sse | streamable-http
      # Additional fields per the canonical mcpServerConfig: oauth (opaque), cwd, headers, url,
      # includeTools, excludeTools, disabledTools, autoApprove, disabled, ...
      # ACIF carries the canonical envelope 1:1 to preserve round-trip with the canonicalizer.

  requires: {}                          # OPTIONAL — empty/absent for v0.1 (Decision #23).
                                        # Restated at spec promotion ([ACIF-MCP] §9): 5 keys
                                        # DERIVABLE by D_K over servers.* (transport_types
                                        # [structurally-constant disposition], oauth_support,
                                        # env_var_expansion [pinned closed field set],
                                        # tool_filtering, auto_approve); 3 OOS-L1 per the walk's
                                        # own table (marketplace, enterprise_management,
                                        # resource_referencing — registry/org/provider concerns);
                                        # nothing goes in requires until a key lacks a D_K
                                        # (empty-as-steady-state, not a gap to fill).
```

**Server names** are within-item identifiers and SHOULD match `^[a-zA-Z][a-zA-Z0-9_-]*$`. Implementations MUST treat server names as opaque strings for cross-reference resolution within an item. The MCP protocol specification (2025-06-18) is silent on config-level server names; this constraint fills the gap without contradicting future MCP working-group decisions. If a future MCP revision defines server-name constraints at the configuration layer, those constraints take precedence over this recommendation.

## Design Decisions

| # | Decision | Rationale |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | `kind` not `content_type` | Shorter; established precedent (Kubernetes); works as a discriminant |
| 2 | `id` is UUID v4, generated once | Only truly immutable option; not derived from any field that can change |
| 3 | `display_name` not `name` | Makes display-only purpose explicit; avoids conflicts with type-specific `name` fields |
| 4 | `license` is an object | `spdx` for machine-readable processing; `file` for repo-hosted text; `url` for externally hosted — both optional, either sufficient |
| 5 | `scripts` is an array | Supports OS-specific entrypoints (bash + `.cmd`) in a single manifest; supports inline scripts |
| 6 | `os` + `arch` not `platform` | "Platform" is overloaded (OS, harness, LLM, architecture). Separate fields are unambiguous. **Amended (platform_commands panel):** `os` values are the closed enum `{windows, linux, darwin}` (exact byte match); `arch` is carried verbatim but does NOT participate in selection in v0.1 (advisory only; zero provider evidence for arch-based selection). Absence, empty-list, selection, and mapping semantics are Decision #33. |
| 7 | `auxiliary_files` = runtime deps | Files the script loads, not what the harness invokes. Harness-invoked files belong in `scripts`. |
| 8 | `requires` not `providers` | Capability requirements are stable; provider lists are brittle and don't reflect partial support. Registry computes provider compatibility from its capability matrix. |
| 9 | `event` is distinct from `display_name` | `event` = WHEN (lifecycle trigger); `display_name` = WHAT (behavior description). A repo can have two hooks on the same event — they need distinct, meaningful names. |
| 10 | Sidecar is the universal primary carrier | Sidecar files are generated for every content type without exception. For hooks and mcp_configs the sidecar is the only input surface. For skills, rules, agents, and commands, frontmatter is an optional supplementary layer — hand-authored or CI-populated. The sidecar is always canonical; frontmatter reflects it, not the other way around. Registries MUST NOT write to source files. |
| 11 | Two-section L2 record (`publisher_section` + `registry_section`) | Structure is the provenance. No merge layer, no per-field markers. `publisher_section` = registry's faithful observation of frontmatter; `registry_section` = computed fields. |
| 12 | `body_hash` is distinct from any external integrity hash | Body hash covers content body bytes only (single-file: frontmatter stripped + LF-normalized; multi-file: MOAT v0.4.0 directory hash per Decision #19). An external integrity system may compute its own hash over different bytes. The two are not interchangeable and the spec does not equate them. |
| 13 | No external system named in spec text | The spec defines a slot (`attestation_hash` in `registry_section`) for an external integrity/attestation hash. What fills that slot is an implementation choice. No specific system is named. |
| 14 | Sidecar binding by `body_hash` | The sidecar's `body_hash` uniquely identifies the content (single file or directory) it annotates. No naming convention required. Multi-file binding resolved via Decision #19 (MOAT directory hash). |
| 15 | Frontmatter CI reconciliation: block on conflict, overwrite on opt-in | When the frontmatter CI finds an ACIF field already present in a source file that conflicts with the canonical sidecar value, the default behavior is to block the build and surface the conflict — no silent overwrites. Auto-overwrite (with logging) is available via an explicit CI input (`conflict-resolution: overwrite`). Missing ACIF fields are added silently (non-destructive). Non-ACIF fields always pass through untouched regardless of setting. |
| 16 | No version inheritance into item records | Item `version` is literal-or-absent. Pack `version` lives on the pack record only. Forbidden item fields: `effective_version`, `derived_version`, `pack_inherited_version`, `resolved_version`. Enforceable by lint and conformance test (TV-6, TV-7). Rationale: per-item version inheritance via derived fields is mostly UI text dressed up as a sync primitive — `body_hash` already serves the change-detection use case at zero author cost. Closes the silent-staleness regression path. |
| 17 | `body_hash` is the canonical per-item change signal, surfaced to all consumers | Sync, update, and discovery tools rely on `body_hash` as the canonical change signal. `version` is advisory; `body_hash` is dispositive. Registries MUST expose `body_hash` in all consumer-facing item responses and MUST provide a per-pack tuple-set endpoint returning `(item_id, body_hash, version_if_declared)` so sync tools poll one pack with one request instead of N item requests. Reinforces Decision #12 with a consumer-surface requirement. |
| 18 | Pack records are `kind: pack` L2 records with stable UUID identity | Pack membership predicate: an item belongs to pack P iff `publisher_section.pack_id == P.id` OR (`publisher_section.pack_id` absent AND `registry_section.inferred_pack_id == P.id`). `pack.registry_section.items` is OUTPUT of the predicate, not input. `pack_resolution` states: `declared | inferred | unresolved`. `display_name` is mutable; `id` (UUID) is immutable. Two paths: publisher-declared (`pack.id` is UUIDv4) and registry-inferred (`inferred_pack_id` is UUIDv5 over canonicalized `repository_url` + `display_name` with a spec-pinned namespace constant). Declared wins over inferred. Pack-less items are first-class. See `panel/pack-model-consensus.md` and Inference Algorithm v0.1 appendix. |
| 19 | `body_hash` algorithm is the MOAT v0.4.0 content-hash algorithm | ACIF adopts MOAT v0.4.0's content-hash algorithm verbatim as the canonical `body_hash` algorithm for both single-file and multi-file items. Key properties: per-file text/binary classification (closed `TEXT_EXTENSIONS` set + 8KB NUL-byte scan), UTF-8 BOM strip + CRLF→LF normalization for text files, raw bytes for binary, directory-level combine, VCS directories excluded, symlinks rejected at ingestion. **ACIF analog of MOAT's `moat-attestation.json` exclusion:** any registry-generated sidecar file stored inside the content directory is excluded from `body_hash` at root-only (circular-dependency guard). **Spec text:** the algorithm is defined inline (or by reference to a published algorithm document); MOAT is credited in informative text only — Decision #13's no-naming rule applies to the `attestation_hash` slot, not to ACIF's own `body_hash` algorithm. **Resolves OQ-2.** Reference impl: `../moat/reference/moat_hash.py`. Test vector generator: `../moat/reference/generate_test_vectors.py` (the test vectors are normatively authoritative; the reference script is informative). **Single/multi-file classification predicate (amended by skills walk):** an item's canonical body is **multi-file** iff, after excluding `{LICENSE*, README*, VCS directories, registry-generated sidecars}` (the root-only exclusion above, extended with `LICENSE*` and `README*`), the body directory contains at least one content file beyond the canonical entry file (e.g., `SKILL.md`); otherwise it is **single-file**. The `body_hash` algorithm is then applied to the classified body. The predicate is **content-type-general**: skill co-located resources AND bundled hook scripts (a command-type hook shipping `my_hook.py` beside the sidecar) are covered cases — editing a bundled hook script moves the change signal, as it must. Opacity-for-derivation (Decision #23 script-body opacity) and inclusion-in-hash are orthogonal; the predicate reinforces the hooks walk rather than reopening it. Without this predicate, two conformant registries could disagree on whether a skill directory's body is `SKILL.md` alone or the whole directory → non-deterministic `body_hash` (same defect class Decision #24 fixed for MCP transport defaults). Test vector: TV-SKILL-body-classification (general). See `panel/skills-requires-consensus.md` §5. **Amended (platform_commands panel, Decision #33):** for sidecar-only content types (no frontmatter surface → no `publisher_section` → no `metadata_hash`), the `body_hash` preimage is the directory hash over file bytes PLUS a canonical serialization of the executable wiring. Without this, re-targeting an `os` tag moved neither hash — silent re-routing invisible to Decision #17's dispositive change signal. **Re-amended at spec promotion (2026-07-11, ratifying [ACIF-HOOK] §9):** the serialized wiring is the ENTIRE canonical extension block (event, matcher, handlers incl. per-entry `type`/`path`/`content`/`os`/`arch` and opaque passthrough, auxiliary_files, blocking, requires, activation_target) — broadened from the panel's `scripts[]`-only scope so that event/activation re-targeting also fires the change signal. Exact serialization pinned in [ACIF-HOOK] §9 (RFC 8785 JCS; canonical array ordering; inline-content CRLF→LF normalization); TV-PLATFORM (q)/(q′) enforce. |
| 20 | When `version` is declared, it MUST be valid SemVer 2.0.0 | Item `version` remains literal-or-absent (Decision #16). When present, the value MUST conform to SemVer 2.0.0. Patch level is permitted but not required — publishers MAY bump minor for any meaningful content change and effectively leave patch as `0`. Rationale: SemVer is the convention the surrounding tooling ecosystem already speaks (npm-style ranges, dependabot-style alerts). CalVer's same-day-edit ambiguity and MAJOR.MINOR's lack of independent value over "SemVer with patch unused" tip the balance. `body_hash` (Decision #17) remains the canonical change signal; `version` is the optional semantic-ordering and human-readability layer. Empirical grounding: [`research/repo-survey/round2-findings.md`](research/repo-survey/round2-findings.md) Versioning section. |
| 21 | Hook → skill activation cross-references use item UUIDv4 | A hook MAY declare `activation_target.skill.id` (UUIDv4 from SHAPE.md line 14) pointing to a skill whose injection it controls. A skill MAY declare `activation.type: manual | auto | hook` with an optional `hook_ref.id` when type is `hook`. Canonical truth lives on the hook (`activation_target`); the skill's `activation` block is a discovery convenience. Cross-references use item UUIDv4 — not `(pack_id, name)` — because UUIDv4 is globally unique by construction, renames don't break references, and no name-stability lint check is required. The `name` field on both sides is human-readable advisory only. This is the first cross-content-type relationship in ACIF; resolving it cleanly with item UUIDs sets the pattern for any future cross-references. Empirical grounding: `diet103/claude-code-infrastructure-showcase` `skill-rules.json` pattern. **Amended (skills walk):** the skill `activation` block adds `user_invocable: bool` (OPTIONAL, default `true`, orthogonal to `type`). The canonicalizer MUST materialize activation defaults at canonicalization time — `type: auto` when the activation block is absent; `user_invocable: true` when absent — and `body_hash` is computed **post-materialization**. Direct parallel of Decision #24's transport-type materialization: one rule, one place, applied before hashing, never re-applied at validation time. This makes the skills-walk `D_K` predicates well-defined on the absent-activation case without three-valued ambiguity; `user_invocable` uses *resolves-to-false* semantics (the signal an installer needs to filter user-invocable skills). Adopted over Remy's adoption-data objection (of surveyed providers, 6 support an equivalent, 7 explicitly don't, and only Claude Code carries an explicit frontmatter key) — preserved as informative caution in `panel/skills-requires-consensus.md` §4. |
| 22 | Three-tier skill discovery: publisher-declared > heuristic+frontmatter > non-conformant | Registries discover skill items via three tiers, in order: (1) **Publisher-declared** — pack manifest declares `skill_paths: ["./skills/", "./advanced/"]`; registry uses those. (2) **Heuristic + filename fallback** — registry scans known directories; accepts `SKILL.md` (canonical filename), any `*.md` with `kind: skill` frontmatter (heuristic), or bare `.md` with the filename used as `name` (fallback). (3) **Non-conformant** — arbitrary layouts with no manifest and no frontmatter are out of scope; publisher action required. Round 1 finding #8 showed ~⅓ of high-star repos ship no manifest at all — tier 2 is essential for adoption. Tier 1 is the "manual pointer" mechanism for publishers with non-standard layouts. Empirical grounding: [`research/repo-survey/round2-findings.md`](research/repo-survey/round2-findings.md) finding #17. |
| 23 | `requires` vocabulary is per-content-type; derivability via predicate `D_K` is the gating test | The `requires` block declares **author-declared capabilities** the harness must support to run the content. **Three-way disposition** for each candidate `requires` key K in a content type's canonical vocabulary: **DERIVABLE** — the spec specifies an explicit derivation predicate `D_K` over the canonical body; a conformance test applies `D_K` directly and asserts the result is one of `{derivable-true, derivable-false}`; K is dropped from `requires` because the predicate provides the signal. **D_K boolean discipline:** set-valued projections (e.g., the distinct values produced by a key, such as the set of transport types or hook event names) are NOT `D_K` outputs; they are computed projections surfaced via Decision #26's `derived_capabilities`. **OUT-OF-SCOPE-AT-L1** — K names a capability concern not author-declared at the L1 canonical layer (harness UX, install-context, meta-property, or **script-body opacity** — where the canonical wiring carries the capability-bearing artifact as opaque bytes, so the field-presence tiebreaker degenerates); recorded in informative rationale; NOT validator-testable. **`requires`-ELIGIBLE** — no `D_K` exists AND the capability IS author-declared; K is admitted to the content type's `requires` vocabulary. **Tiebreaker rule:** canonical field present → DERIVABLE (cite the field). Canonical field absent + capability would be authored if present → spec gap (add the field or admit to `requires`). Canonical field absent + capability is harness-decided or install-context-determined → OUT-OF-SCOPE-AT-L1. **Empty-as-steady-state:** the structural slot exists per content type (preserves cross-type uniformity), but empty `requires` is the EXPECTED steady state when canonical wiring fully exposes capability. Empty slots are NOT gaps to fill; the slot exists for the unauthored-but-required case (runtime hints, version pins, capabilities not yet expressed in any canonical field). **MCP application:** of the eight Syllago canonical capability keys, five (`transport_types`, `oauth_support`, `env_var_expansion`, `tool_filtering`, `auto_approve`) are DERIVABLE per per-key predicates over `servers.*` fields and three (`marketplace`, `enterprise_management`, `resource_referencing`) are OUT-OF-SCOPE-AT-L1 (registry-inference / org-policy / provider-UX concerns, per the walk's own table — the earlier "all eight DERIVABLE" summary was restated under the mature three-way vocabulary at spec promotion, [ACIF-MCP] §9/Appendix B; result unchanged). `mcp.requires` is therefore empty/absent for v0.1. **Agents application:** all seven Syllago canonical agent capability keys resolve to DERIVABLE — `tool_restrictions` (`D_K: len(B.Tools)>0 OR len(B.DisallowedTools)>0`); `model_selection` (`D_K: B.Model != ""`); `per_agent_mcp` (`D_K: len(B.MCPServers)>0`); `subagent_spawning` (`D_K: contains(B.Tools, "agent")` — depends on Decision #25 canonical-tool-name pinning) — or OUT-OF-SCOPE-AT-L1 — `definition_format` (meta-property: canonical body IS the format); `invocation_patterns` (harness UX picker concern); `agent_scopes` (install-location-determined at L3/L4). `agents.requires` is therefore empty/absent for v0.1. **Hooks application:** Of nine Syllago canonical hook capability keys, three resolve to DERIVABLE — `handler_types` (`D_K: exists i. B.Hooks[i].Type != ""` with closed enum `{command, http, prompt, agent}` pinned per Decision #29; the set of distinct types is registry-projected to `derived_capabilities`); `matcher_patterns` (`D_K: B.Matcher != ""` with canonical event vocabulary pinned per Decision #29); `async_execution` (`D_K: exists i. B.Hooks[i].Async == true`). Six resolve to OUT-OF-SCOPE-AT-L1 — `hook_scopes` (install-location, parallel to agents' `agent_scopes`); `decision_control`, `input_modification`, `json_io_protocol`, `context_injection`, `permission_control` (all under script-body opacity — capability semantics live in script body bytes that the canonical wiring carries opaquely). Runtime hints (`python: ">=3.10"`, `node: ">=18"`, `powershell: true`) deferred to the ACIF roadmap. `hooks.requires` is therefore empty/absent for v0.1; three content types now resolve empty under Decision #23 (empty-as-steady-state holds three-for-three). **Skills application:** Of fifteen Syllago canonical skill capability keys, four resolve to DERIVABLE — `auto_invocable` (`D_K: B.activation absent OR B.activation.type == "auto"` — single-clause, post-default-materialization; the strawman's `description != ""` conjunct was dropped after three reviewers independently rejected it: description quality is a lint/moderation concern, not a derivability input); `disable_model_invocation` (`D_K: B.activation.type ∈ {manual, hook}` — activation-absent → materialized `auto` → derivable-false); `user_invocable` (`D_K: B.activation.user_invocable == false` — *resolves-to-false* semantics post-materialization; gated on the Decision #21 amendment, adopted); `skill_bundled_resources` (`D_K:` the canonical body classifies as multi-file under Decision #19's classification predicate — the exclusion list resolves the `LICENSE`+`README` false positive). Eleven resolve to OUT-OF-SCOPE-AT-L1 — `display_name`, `description`, `license`, `compatibility`, `metadata_map` (meta-property; `description` is load-bearing as a moderation/injection surface, not as a `requires` signal); `version` (common envelope, Decisions #16/#20); `project_scope`, `global_scope`, `shared_scope` (install-location → `install_scope_capabilities` projection); `canonical_filename`, `custom_filename` (discovery/filename meta — Decision #22). `skills.requires` is therefore empty/absent for v0.1 — four content types now resolve empty (empty-as-steady-state holds **four-for-four**, with the recorded caveat that the streak is "credible, getting thin"; rules — the prose-purest content type — is the load-bearing test of the principle). Latent `SkillMeta` fields (`AllowedTools` / `DisallowedTools` / `Model` / bundled `Hooks`) are named out-of-scope pending OQ-10 — and latent-field presence MUST NOT soften the orphan-key reject (a `requires.tool_restrictions` on a skill is non-conformant even though a matching latent field exists). **Rules application:** Of five Syllago canonical rule capability keys, one resolves to DERIVABLE — `activation_mode` (`D_K: B.activation.mode ∈ {glob, model_decision, manual}` — positive-set form (a future enum member is derivable-false until explicitly added), post-materialization per Decision #30; canonicalization rejects malformed inputs before `D_K` runs, so the predicate only ever sees validated enum members; the declared mode and globs are set-valued → `derived_capabilities`). Four resolve to OUT-OF-SCOPE-AT-L1 — `file_imports` (prose-body opacity under the out-of-band guardrail below; **recorded as the strongest `requires`-candidate the OQ-7 walks have surfaced** — non-derivable, author-created, real silent-failure class (an unresolved `@path` import degrades to literal text on the 5/10 non-supporting providers); first 2:2 panel split of the series, resolved by Holden to REJECT on reversibility asymmetry (adding a `requires` key later is additive; removing a shipped one is breaking), adoption empirics (the npm-engines-without-enforcement precedent — an undeclared majority yields installer false-all-clears), and cross-type coherence with OQ-8; coupled to unified OQ-8 — becomes DERIVABLE, never `requires`-eligible, if a reference grammar is pinned); `cross_provider_recognition` (provider-side format recognition — capability-matrix/L4); `auto_memory` (provider-runtime feature, outside the publish pipeline); `hierarchical_loading` (provider-matrix fact → `provider_capability_coverage` projection, NOT `install_scope_capabilities` — none of its three provenance tags can honestly source a provider-capability fact). `rules.requires` is therefore empty/absent for v0.1 — **empty-as-steady-state holds five-for-five**, via the hard route: the strawman deliberately proposed the first eligible key (honoring "do not force empty"), the panel split 2:2, and the resolution was on the merits. **Out-of-band eligibility guardrail (rules walk, standing normative test):** `requires`-eligibility requires an out-of-band dependency. A capability is `requires`-eligible only when the artifact depends on something it does not contain — an environmental assumption external to the body (runtime version, host service capability). Any capability whose evidence lives *in the body* — structured field, prose, or script bytes — is resolved by the body: DERIVABLE if a canonical field carries it, OUT-OF-SCOPE-AT-L1 under body opacity if only the opaque bytes carry it. A body-carried capability is never `requires`-eligible, regardless of whether a canonical field for it is missing. "The body mentions/uses X" (an `@import`, a referenced MCP tool, a spawned hook) is a body-content fact → derivable-or-opaque, never `requires`. This unifies the hooks walk's two rationales (runtime hints: out-of-band → roadmap-eligible; `decision_control`: in-body-opaque → OOS) and pre-empts shoehorn-by-analogy for the commands walk. The works-fine-without-it test is retained as the **severity** test (grades how badly an OOS capability's absence bites — moderation priority, OQ-8 urgency), not the eligibility test. The `requires` bucket's reserved tenant is out-of-band environmental pins (runtime hints, roadmap). **Commands application (final walk — OQ-7 closes):** Both Syllago canonical command capability keys resolve to OUT-OF-SCOPE-AT-L1 — `argument_substitution` (body-content opacity: the `$ARGUMENTS` token lives in body prose; the proposed body-token `D_K` was rejected 3:1 as a heuristic — false-positives on fenced-code mentions [the token is canonicalizer-normalized, not canonicalizer-validated], false-negatives on untranslated positional forms `$1/$2/${@:N}`, and derives narrower than its own key; disposed uniformly with rules' `file_imports`; body piece → advisory token-presence projection [MAY-compute, method-stamped, non-gating, disclosed imprecision, installers SHOULD warn on the join], provider piece → `provider_capability_coverage` 6/10) and `builtin_commands` (provider-matrix fact → `provider_capability_coverage` 6/10; severity finding: HIGH in the shadowing direction — a published command colliding with a provider builtin resolves to the wrong handler silently; the normative shadowing check is infeasible [per-release, per-plan builtin lists — the Decision #8 brittle-list trap]; registry-discretion lint + roadmap builtin-namespace entry). `commands.requires` is therefore empty/absent for v0.1. **Derivation-vs-heuristic refinement (commands walk, standing):** a `D_K` must be a *derivation* — correct by construction over canonical structured content (a field, an array, an enum value validated at canonicalization before the predicate runs) — never a *heuristic* (a usually-right scan). Substring or pattern scans over unstructured body prose are heuristics regardless of whether the scanned token is canonicalization-pinned; a normalized token is canonical *as a token*, but presence-of-token-in-prose is not a derivation *of a capability*. Heuristics MAY ship only as advisory projections with disclosed imprecision (both error directions documented, method-version-stamped, never gating), never as DERIVABLE dispositions. **Three-way routing (OQ-7 series close):** every capability the six content types express routes to one of three destinations, and only the third is `requires` — a **body-carried** fact is resolved by the body (DERIVABLE when correct-by-construction over canonical structure; OOS-L1 when only opaque prose or a lexical heuristic carries it); a **provider-matrix** fact is a registry projection (`provider_capability_coverage`, per Decision #8); only a **user-environment** fact — author-declared, neither body-derivable nor matrix-knowable — is `requires`-eligible. No walked vocabulary contains one. Empty-as-steady-state closes **six-for-six, validated**: across the series exactly one requires-adjacent scaffold was ever surfaced (skills' activation-default materialization), and the final walk's emptiness is robust under scaffold removal (either disposition of `argument_substitution` leaves `requires` empty). The slot is **reserved, not vestigial** — predicted first tenant: runtime hints (`python: ">=3.10"`), roadmap. **D_K string discipline (skills walk):** predicates over string fields treat whitespace-only strings as non-empty — Strict `len(s) > 0` — uniformly across all `D_K` predicates, all content types. **Compound-predicate discipline (standing):** if a future `D_K` compounds, every conjunct MUST cite a single canonical field with explicit edge-case definition (empty/absent/null/whitespace). **Three-valued unknown-key logic:** when a `requires` key exists but the consumer doesn't recognize it, the evaluation is `unknown` — distinct from `satisfied` and `unsatisfied`. Two-valued semantics (silent fail-open or silent fail-closed on unknown keys) are non-conformant; installers MUST refuse items with `unknown` capability status unless the operator has explicitly opted into ignore-unknown semantics. **Cross-content-type scoping:** each content type defines its own recognized `requires` vocabulary; an item with a `requires.<key>` not defined for its content type is non-conformant (orphan-key reject). **Sub-blocks rejected by panel review** (MCP walk): `marketplace_listings` (publisher is wrong source of truth — aggregator-pulls-not-publisher-pushes), `enterprise` (no honest equilibrium for `managed_default_candidate`; `notes` is unmoderable free-text at registry scale), `advisory` (silent-failure shape; works-fine-without-it test fails). **Misclassified candidates dropped** (MCP walk): `sandbox` and `interactive_inputs` are harness UX/policy (runtime/IDE concerns), not author-declared capabilities — they do not belong in `requires` regardless of adoption. **Roadmap entries:** `env_file_reference`, `path_variable_expansion` as candidate MCP `requires` keys if they ever become genuinely non-derivable (today both are observable in `servers.*` string values via predicate). Panel: Remy / Karpathy / spec-purist / registry-operator (see `panel/mcp-requires-consensus.md` for the MCP deliberation, `panel/agents-requires-consensus.md` for the agents deliberation and the three-way-disposition amendment, `panel/hooks-requires-consensus.md` for the hooks deliberation including the script-body opacity sub-rationale, D_K boolean discipline, and the 3:1 Position A selection, `panel/skills-requires-consensus.md` for the skills deliberation — unanimous-result-with-amendment-menu shape, the Decision #19/#21 amendments, and the OP-COND-SKILLS dispositions `panel/rules-requires-consensus.md` for the rules deliberation — first 2:2 split, the out-of-band guardrail, Decision #30, the OP-COND-RULES dispositions — and `panel/commands-requires-consensus.md` for the commands deliberation: 3:1 invariant split, the derivation-vs-heuristic refinement, the three-way routing, Decision #31, and the OP-COND-COMMANDS dispositions). **OQ-7 is fully resolved** — the principle layer and all six per-content-type walks. |
| 24 | MCP wiring canonicalization: defaults at canonicalization, ambiguous and undetermined rejected | The canonicalizer MUST materialize the explicit `type` field on each MCP server before `body_hash` is computed. Default application rules: `type` absent + `command` present + `url` absent → materialize `type: stdio`; `type` absent + `url` present + `command` absent → materialize `type: streamable-http`; `type` absent + both `command` and `url` present → REJECT (`acif.mcp.transport_default_ambiguous`); `type` absent + neither → REJECT (`acif.mcp.transport_default_undetermined`). `body_hash` is computed over the post-default canonical form. Renderers to provider-specific formats MAY strip explicit `type` for ergonomic output; round-trip back to canonical form is deterministic via the same single-source default rule. **Rationale:** prevents drift between the canonicalizer's default application and any consumer's default application — one rule, one place to update. Validators consume the post-default canonical form and MUST NOT re-apply defaults at validation time. Test vectors TV-MCP-* exercise the default-application boundary; the ambiguous and undetermined cases produce conformance errors with named error codes for tooling interop. |
| 25 | Canonical neutral tool vocabulary (ACIF-owned — Appendix C.1) | ACIF owns the canonical neutral tool vocabulary as normative spec text: **Appendix C.1** (17 names, per-provider mapping table, reverse-translation tiebreakers, matcher discipline, MCP tool-name formats). The spawn-subagent tool is the canonical neutral name `agent` (render-back to provider-specific `Agent` / `task` / `spawn_agent` / `use_subagent` / `Task`). `body_hash` (Decision #19) is computed over the post-translation canonical form — canonicalization rewrites provider-specific tool names to canonical neutral names before hashing. **Repatriated 2026-07-11 (HANDOFF Step 4):** originally pinned by frozen-snapshot reference to Syllago's `cli/internal/converter/toolmap.go`; the vocabulary was inlined from that snapshot (syllago @ `cf047f52`, informative provenance) and the authority direction inverted — syllago/capmon now conform to ACIF's copy. **Required by:** Decision #23 agents application — the `subagent_spawning` derivability predicate `D_K: contains(B.Tools, "agent")` is unfulfillable without canonical-name pinning. **Test vectors:** TV-AGENT-derivability-subagent-spawning and TV-AGENT-tool-name-canonicalization (Appendix B). See `panel/agents-requires-consensus.md` §3. |
| 26 | Registry-computed `derived_capabilities` projection | Every conforming registry MUST compute a `derived_capabilities` projection on each item at ingest, applying each DERIVABLE key's predicate `D_K` (Decision #23) over the canonical body. Projection is registry-computed; NOT carried in the L2 `publisher_section` (zero author burden). Exposed on registry-surface item responses for installer-side capability filtering. Exact on-the-wire format deferred until registry implementation needs are observed; the compute requirement is normative now. See `panel/agents-requires-consensus.md` §6a. |
| 27 | `body_size_bytes` registry field — addendum to Decision #19 | Every conforming registry MUST expose `body_size_bytes` (uint, byte count of the canonical body input to the `body_hash` algorithm) alongside `body_hash` on item responses. Supports content-moderation cost-bounding at serve time without re-fetching the body. **Motivation:** agent and skill prose bodies become system prompts at runtime — injection content there is load-bearing, and registries need a cheap pre-filter signal to bound moderation scan cost. Cheap registry-compute hook already present at ingest (the body bytes are already in hand to compute `body_hash`). See `panel/agents-requires-consensus.md` §6b. |
| 28 | Cross-content-type reference resolution enum | For cross-content-type references carried on items (e.g., `agent.MCPServers []string` referencing `mcp_config` items; `agent.Skills []string` referencing `skill` items), every conforming registry MUST resolve each reference at compute time into one of four states: `declared | resolved | unresolved | revoked`. Each resolved reference exposes the resolved target's UUIDv4; `unresolved` and `revoked` references MUST emit diagnostics naming the missing or revoked target. Install tools MUST refuse items with any `unresolved` or `revoked` reference unless the operator has explicitly opted in (parallel to Decision #18's `pack_resolution: unresolved` install-refuse rule). Parallel in shape to Decision #18's `pack_resolution` enum, but per-reference rather than per-item. See `panel/agents-requires-consensus.md` §6c. |
| 29 | Canonical hook event vocabulary + handler-type enum (ACIF-owned — Appendix C.2/C.3) | ACIF owns two canonical hook vocabularies as normative spec text. (a) **Canonical hook event vocabulary** — **Appendix C.2**: 39 canonical event names (`before_tool_execute`, `session_start`, `permission_request`, etc.) with the full per-provider mapping table and the pinned reverse-translation tiebreaker (the original "approximately 30" estimate resolved to exactly 39 at repatriation). (b) **Handler-type closed enum** — **Appendix C.3**: `type ∈ {command, http, prompt, agent}` with per-type field sets and the absent-type→`command` legacy residual materialized at canonicalization. Canonicalization rewrites provider-specific event names and handler-type names to the pinned canonical vocabulary before `body_hash` (Decision #19) is computed. Renderers MAY translate to provider-specific names at render-back. **Repatriated 2026-07-11 (HANDOFF Step 4):** originally pinned by frozen-snapshot reference to Syllago's `toolmap.go`/`hooks.go`; inlined from that snapshot (syllago @ `cf047f52`, informative provenance) and the authority direction inverted — syllago/capmon now conform to ACIF's copy. Long-tail provider coverage (~16 events have single-provider coverage) is observational, not a relaxation of the canonical vocabulary. **Required by:** Decision #23 hooks application — the `D_K: handler_types` predicate over `Hooks[*].Type` and the canonical event-name round-trip conformance test are unfulfillable without pinned closed-enum vocabularies. **Test vectors:** TV-HOOK-canonical-event-name and TV-HOOK-canonical-handler-type (Appendix B). Parallel structure to Decision #25. See `panel/hooks-requires-consensus.md` §5. |
| 30 | Canonical rule activation-mode vocabulary (ACIF-originated) | **ACIF's first owned vocabulary** — no frozen-snapshot reference, because no Syllago struct exists to freeze: `RuleMeta{Description, AlwaysApply, Globs}` cannot represent `manual` vs `model_decision` (both are `AlwaysApply:false, Globs:nil`). This is HANDOFF Step 4's authority inversion arriving early; the rules enum is the pilot for repatriating Decisions #25/#29 (syllago/capmon conform to ACIF's copy). Three published components: **(1) Closed enum** — `always` (loaded unconditionally), `glob` (loaded when files matching `globs` are in context), `model_decision` (model decides from description/context), `manual` (loaded only on explicit user invocation — @-mention, slash command, or equivalent). **(2) Total canonicalization mapping table** over all six observed provider sub-modes: `always_on → always`; `glob → glob`; `frontmatter_globs → glob` (documented collapse — declaration mechanism differs, activation semantics identical); `model_decision → model_decision`; `manual → manual`; `slash_command → manual` (zed — slash invocation is explicit user invocation). Deterministic legacy residual: a provider form carrying only `AlwaysApply=false` + no globs maps to `model_decision`; `manual` is reachable only from source formats carrying the distinction explicitly (windsurf `trigger: manual`, zed) or from ACIF-native authoring. Any provider mode with no mapping row → REJECT `acif.rule.activation_mode_unmappable`. **(3) Materialization + rejection rules:** activation block absent → materialize `mode: always` (matches all 10 surveyed providers' no-frontmatter default); `body_hash` computed post-materialization; validators MUST NOT re-apply defaults (parallel to Decisions #24/#21). Block present without `mode` → `acif.rule.activation_mode_missing` (mode is the primary discriminant, parallel to skills' `type` required-when-present; defaulting a present block would silently mislabel glob intent). Unknown or non-exact value (`" always"`) → `acif.rule.activation_mode_invalid` — enum membership is an exact byte match (no trim, no case-fold), stricter than and subsuming the Strict `len(s) > 0` rule. `mode: glob` without `globs` → `acif.rule.glob_mode_without_globs`; `globs` with `mode ≠ glob` → `acif.rule.globs_without_glob_mode`. **Required by:** Decision #23 rules application — the `activation_mode` `D_K` and rules render-back determinism are unfulfillable without the pinned enum + total mapping (a 4-value projection over an unpinned mapping is the Decision #24 defect class). Empirical grounding: 10-provider capability matrix, 6 observed activation sub-modes; windsurf's source format carries all four canonical values distinctly. Informative caution (Remy, preserved): the enum is richer than Syllago's current `RuleMeta` can round-trip; the mapping table's deterministic residual is the mitigation, and `RuleMeta` enrichment is Step 4 repatriation work. **Test vectors:** TV-RULE-* family (Appendix B). See `panel/rules-requires-consensus.md` §5. |
| 31 | Canonical argument-placeholder vocabulary + rewrite (ACIF-owned) | **Second ACIF-owned vocabulary** (after Decision #30; not folded into it — different disciplines: #30 is closed-enum-with-reject-codes over a discriminant field; #31 is body-token-rewrite with zero reject codes). **Core-primitive regardless of any capability disposition:** the `{{args}}/${input:} → $ARGUMENTS` normalization already changes `body_hash` bytes and was pinned only in Syllago's converter — an unpinned external rewrite under ACIF's canonical hash is the Decision #24 defect class. Components: **(1) Vocabulary + total mapping table.** Canonical token `$ARGUMENTS` (indexed form `$ARGUMENTS[N]`). Mappings: `$ARGUMENTS`/`$ARGUMENTS[N]` → identity; `{{args}}` (gemini) → `$ARGUMENTS` (lossless); `${input:varName}` and `${input:varName:placeholder}` (VS Code family) → `$ARGUMENTS` (**lossy** — named → single positional; canonicalization MUST emit INFORMATIVE diagnostic `acif.command.placeholder_named_arg_collapsed`; render-back non-identity documented). `body_hash` computed post-rewrite. Rewrites are non-markdown-aware (tokens inside code fences ARE rewritten; fence-awareness is roadmap, coupled to OQ-8). **(2) Positional forms (`$1`, `$2`, `${@:N}`) are documented-unrecognized:** they cannot map to `$ARGUMENTS` without destroying positional semantics, and detecting them for rewrite would mutate legitimate shell content in bodies; carried verbatim, no rewrite, no advisory signal — a disclosed false-negative. Roadmap: positional canonicalization only with OQ-8-grade structure. **(3) Scope exclusion (anti-shoehorn):** gemini's `!{...}` (shell-command injection) and `@{...}` (file inclusion) are dynamic-content-injection directives, NOT argument substitution — outside this vocabulary, carried verbatim, recorded as threat context. **(4) No escape form:** a literal `$ARGUMENTS` in rendered output is not expressible in v0.1 (documented limitation; no invented escape grammar). **(5) Token boundary + exactness:** exact bytes, case-sensitive; `$ARGUMENTS` is recognized when the immediately-following byte is not in `[A-Za-z0-9_]` (end-of-body qualifies; `[` qualifies so `$ARGUMENTS[N]` is recognized; `$ARGUMENTSFOO` is not). Zero reject codes — an unrecognized token passes through as opaque prose (deliberate asymmetry with #30, because no closed enum over a field is being validated). **Repatriation note:** the boundary rule is stricter than Syllago's own naive `strings.Contains` render-back warnings — Syllago conforms to ACIF's copy (Step 4 direction). The §-referenced advisory token-presence projection (registry MAY compute `{present, method}`) uses this boundary rule; it is advisory only — never a `D_K` (Decision #23 derivation-vs-heuristic refinement). **Test vectors:** TV-COMMAND-* family (Appendix B). See `panel/commands-requires-consensus.md` §5. |
| 32 | `source_uri` normative specification (resolves OQ-11) | **Framing / identity firewall:** `registry_section.source_uri` is **registry-scoped provenance, not identity** — a `(fetched_at, body_hash)`-scoped fetch pointer. It MUST NOT be an input to `body_hash`, `metadata_hash`, or any UUID derivation, and MUST NOT be used as a cross-registry join key (cross-registry identity is `body_hash`; grouping is `inferred_pack_id`). Two conformant registries MAY record different `source_uri` values for byte-identical content. Only the registry can violate these rules; conformance is tested at the registry-emit boundary across two harnesses — static string vectors (the pipeline) and mock-transport vectors (redirect semantics) — and MUST NOT be claimed on the string vectors alone. **Validity + scheme:** MUST be a valid RFC 3986 absolute URI with non-empty authority (`acif.source_uri.malformed`; absence → `acif.source_uri.missing`); scheme MUST be in a **closed allowlist whose v0.1 content is exactly `{https}`** (`acif.source_uri.scheme_forbidden`; `javascript:`/`data:`/`file:`/`vbscript:`/`blob:` rejected by construction; roadmap-reserved: `oci`, `ipfs`, private-origin `http` + `insecure_origin` flag); no userinfo (`acif.source_uri.userinfo_present` — closes credential leakage and the scp-short `git@` shape); host recorded in A-label form (unconvertible IDN → `malformed`; full IDNA2008 profile → roadmap). **Scope statement:** content with no https-dereferenceable URL is out of scope for conformant v0.1 records — no sentinel value exists. **Ordered normalization pipeline (order is normative):** parse → reject userinfo → case normalization per §6.2.2.1 (lowercase scheme+host, uppercase percent-hex; **path is case-sensitive, never folded**) → scheme gate → percent-decode unreserved per §6.2.2.2 → dot-segment removal per §6.2.2.3 (steps in this order so `%2E%2E` decodes then collapses — reversed order leaves encoded dot-segments, the Decision #24 defect class with a path-traversal flavor) → §6.2.3 scheme-based (strip `:443`, empty path → `/`) → fragment removal → query prohibition → single-file trailing-slash check. Idempotent by requirement. **Query prohibition:** the emitted `source_uri` MUST NOT contain a query (`acif.source_uri.query_present`; dangling `?` removed). Eliminates the credential class (`?token=`, `X-Amz-*`, SAS, signed params) by construction; origins whose fetch requires a query are unrepresentable in v0.1 (Tier-1 publisher-declared paths are the roadmap home). **Redirect semantics (canonical resolution, NOT final-URL):** follow and record **permanent redirects only (301/308** — the origin asserting an identity move); across **temporary redirects (302/303/307)** the **requested URL is recorded** (delivery/balancing/signing mechanics — e.g. signed asset URLs expiring in minutes — are not identity); redirect-injected signed queries never persisted; every hop MUST be https (`acif.source_uri.redirect_downgrade`); chain bounded by `ACIF_SOURCE_URI_MAX_REDIRECTS = 10` (`acif.source_uri.redirect_limit`); at record time the recorded value MUST NOT re-dereference to a permanent redirect. **Re-crawl stability invariant:** `body_hash` unchanged + no permanent redirect observed ⇒ `source_uri` byte-identical across crawls (makes TV-11+ byte-for-byte vectors authorable; makes `fetched_at` legible). **Direct file URLs:** for items classifying single-file under Decision #19, the path MUST NOT end in `/` (`acif.source_uri.direct_file_trailing_slash`) and the last path segment (post-pipeline, case-sensitive) is the URL-derived filename feeding Decision #22 tier-2 fallback discovery deterministically; on conflict with a frontmatter-declared name the registry MUST record **both** and emit `acif.source_uri.filename_conflict` — never silently override (Decision #15 philosophy). Multi-file: directory root, trailing `/` legitimate, no filename semantics. **`source_status`** (OPTIONAL registry field): `live \| moved \| gone \| unreachable`, set at crawl time — dead links become a consumer signal, not silent staleness. **A.3 reconciliation:** `canonical_repository_url` (whole-URL lowercase, identity collapse for pack inference) and `source_uri` normalization are different pipelines for different contracts and MUST NOT share an implementation; A.3's path-lowercasing is scoped to pack inference only (documented identity-collapse hazard). **OQ-9 dependency:** the two-tier freshness comparison presumes a stable re-fetchable `source_uri`; this decision is its precondition. Mini-review: spec-purist + registry-operator (first two-reviewer mini-review). **Test vectors:** TV-URI-* family (Appendix B). See `panel/source-uri-consensus.md`. **Amended (Decision #35):** mixed-chain composition rule (permanent-prefix; first temporary redirect freezes the recorded value), structural stability-invariant guard (empty permanent prefix), record-time re-dereference restated as the composition rule's by-construction outcome, and `source_status = moved` decoupled to fire on a permanent observed anywhere in the chain. |
| 33 | Per-OS script selection + canonicalization (resolves OQ-6) | **Third ACIF-owned vocabulary + first selection semantics.** Written **type-general** (any script entry carrying `os`/`arch`), instantiated on hooks only in v0.1. **(1) Closed OS enum** `{windows, linux, darwin}`, exact byte match (no trim/fold, Decision #30 discipline); non-member → `acif.hook.script_os_invalid`; provider aliases (`osx`) rewritten pre-validation and never present in canonical form. **(2) Absence/empty semantics (OQ-6 resolved):** `os` absent = **unconstrained** (selection candidate on every enum member); absent is NOT canonicalized to the full enumeration (distinct canonical bytes — rewriting silently moves `body_hash`, Decision #24 defect class); `os: []` ≠ absent — matches nothing, authoring error → `acif.hook.script_os_empty` (likewise `script_arch_empty`). **`arch` does not participate in selection in v0.1** (zero provider evidence) — carried verbatim, advisory in `derived_capabilities`; arch selection is roadmap, gated on a closed arch enum + alias mapping. **(3) Selection = disjointness, not specificity.** "Most-specific-wins" rejected as undefined (overlapping os×arch coverage sets are incomparable — co-matching entries with neither containing the other leave the rule silent = two conformant harnesses run different scripts). Match predicate `M(E,o) := (E.os absent) ∨ (o ∈ E.os)`; `os`-absent entries are **default** entries, others **constrained**. Canonicalization MUST verify: ≤1 default (else `acif.hook.script_default_ambiguous`); for every enum member, ≤1 matching constrained entry (else `acif.hook.script_platform_ambiguous`, diagnostic naming colliding OS values + entry indices). All ambiguity diagnostics MUST be fix-forward. Runtime selection is total: unique constrained match → run; else default; else **defined no-op** + `acif.hook.script_no_platform_match`. Only precedence: constrained-beats-default. The untagged multi-script layout (`.sh`+`.ps1`+`.cmd`, no tags) rejects as multiple defaults — deliberately (it IS ambiguous); registry guidance: measure reject rates. Recorded honestly: ambiguity-reject closes non-determinism, NOT the decoy attack (benign default + malicious `os:[windows]` override is well-formed). **(4) Total canonicalization mapping:** vs-code-copilot `windows/linux/osx`+`command` → singleton constrained entries + default (lossless, provenance `declared`); copilot-cli `bash`→`os:[linux,darwin]`, `powershell`→`os:[windows]` (semantically wrong as a general claim — pwsh is cross-platform — kept on the **entrypoint-count rationale**: two command fields = two entrypoints, mappable; MUST-emit `acif.hook.platform_shell_os_proxy`, provenance `inferred-from-convention`); cline filename convention `.ps1`/`.cmd`/`.bat`→`[windows]`, `.sh`/extensionless→`[linux,darwin]`, other → default entry + `acif.hook.platform_filename_uninferable` (success → `platform_filename_inferred`, INFORMATIVE; provenance `inferred-from-convention`); claude-code `shell:` **excluded** (one entrypoint + interpreter flag — nothing to map; anti-shoehorn parallel to #31's `!{}`/`@{}`; carried opaque; `shell: powershell` recorded as the runtime-hint-shaped future `requires` tenant); unmapped mechanism → `acif.hook.platform_unmappable` (totality net). **(5) Hash boundary (amends Decision #19):** for sidecar-only types (no frontmatter → no `publisher_section` → no `metadata_hash`), the `body_hash` preimage = Decision #19 directory hash over file bytes **plus a canonical serialization of the wiring**, computed post-rewrite. Closes the re-targeting hole (flipping an `os` tag previously moved NO hash — silent re-routing invisible to the Decision #17 change signal) and makes whole-item attestation cover routing. **Serialization scope broadened at spec promotion (2026-07-11):** the entire canonical extension block, not only `scripts[]` (post-mapping `type`/`path`/`os`/`arch`/opaque passthrough incl. `shell:` remain covered; event/matcher/activation_target re-targeting now also moves the hash). Exact serialization pinned in [ACIF-HOOK] §9; TV-PLATFORM (q)/(q′) enforce. **(6) Render-back:** to a no-mechanism provider — emit default, drop constrained entries, MUST-emit `acif.hook.platform_override_dropped` (absence of the diagnostic on a drop is non-conformant); no-default branch — emit the entry matching a declared target OS, else MUST refuse `acif.hook.no_default_for_degraded_render` (the one carve-out from never-MUST-refuse: no defined-safe output); **structured-encoder rule** — ALL opaque passthrough values re-serialized through the target format's structured encoder, never string-spliced; dead-defaults MUST NOT be stripped (breaks round-trip to HIF's REQUIRED `command`). **(7) Install-time coverage-gap rule:** per install-target segment — no matching entry + no default + `blocking: true` → install MUST refuse on that segment (operator opt-in to override; a silently-absent security control is fail-open); `blocking: false` → SHOULD warn, proceeds as defined no-op. `blocking` is the criticality discriminant already in the schema. **(8) Registry projection** `os_coverage` (see Registry Section Schema): `{derivable, os, arch, unconstrained, os_divergent, provenance}` — all correct-by-construction over `scripts[]`; `os_divergent` (>1 distinct entrypoint across disjoint OS regions) is the enterprise-policy enabler (`os` set alone cannot distinguish one portable script from N per-OS programs); `provenance ∈ {declared, inferred-from-convention, mixed}` distinguishes authored tags from decode-heuristic guesses. `provider_capability_coverage.platform_commands` **deferred** — zero capmon backing verified (12/12 per-provider hooks files carry no platform field; vs-code-copilot absent from the provider set); roadmap, gated on capmon schema acquiring a per-OS field; proxy mechanisms MUST NOT be laundered in as support. **Never `requires`:** an all-`os:[windows]` hook is body-carried adaptation (canonical field), not an out-of-band declaration — DERIVABLE under the guardrail; `hooks.requires` stays empty; OQ-7's six-for-six untouched. **Severity finding: HIGH in the review-evasion direction** (a divergent hook resolves to an unreviewed branch on the target OS silently; parallel to `builtin_commands` shadowing), moderation priority below the always-executes classes (gated evasion, not a new execution primitive); `body_hash` is anti-swap/anti-blindness — "complete in coverage, not in inspection" — never a divergence mitigation; v0.1 posture: surface (divergence signal + provenance + fix-forward diagnostics), don't solve (behavioral detonation → roadmap). Roadmap: content-revocation feed keyed on `body_hash` (HIGH, general gap, this feature motivating). Panel: registry-operator / spec-purist / valsorda / enterprise-security (first supply-chain/enterprise seats); four splits resolved by Holden. **Test vectors:** TV-PLATFORM-* family (Appendix B).

| 34 | Two-tier freshness orthogonality (resolves OQ-9) | **Freshness and attestation-validity are orthogonal axes — never combined.** The strawman's `min(sidecar expires, attestation expiry)` was rejected by both reviewers from opposite directions: unimplementable (no ACIF field carries an attestation expiry — a rule over an unobservable operand is untestable) and operationally vacuous-or-storm ("attestation expiry" is not a well-defined scalar; log-based attestations are permanent → min does nothing, cert-window attestations are ~10min → the attested index flips stale on a clock the registry doesn't own). **(1) Three clocks, named:** item-sidecar (`fetched_at`/`expires`) — the ONLY input to item staleness; attestation — the external system's validity window, consumer-evaluated under that system's own rules, never a staleness input; response-envelope (`generated_at`/`max_staleness`) — computing item staleness from `generated_at` is non-conforming (third-clock conflation). **(2) Crawl-axis staleness predicate (consumer-evaluated):** stale at consumer time `T` (UTC) iff `T > E_sidecar`, where `E_sidecar` = `expires` if present else `fetched_at + 72h` (always defined; `fetched_at` REQUIRED). All freshness fields MUST be RFC 3339 with explicit offset; offsetless → malformed. Skew tolerance, if any, MUST be explicit, bounded, fail-closed (borderline ⇒ stale). `expires < fetched_at` → malformed window, `acif.registry.expires_before_fetched_at` (fix-forward) — distinct from legitimately-already-past `expires`, which is well-formed, evaluates stale, and is conforming to serve (honest crawl backlog). **(3) Attestation axis = trust tier** `{attested, unattested}`: a lapsed, unreachable, or unverifiable attestation degrades the tier and MUST NOT set the staleness bit (content unchanged; the crawl snapshot is unaffected; losing attestation means the extra assurance can't be proven, never that content is stale). The registry MUST NOT parse the external attestation manifest, MUST NOT bake any combined value, and its item response MUST be **byte-identical whether or not the attestation system is reachable** (CDN-safety, outage decoupling, Decision #13 agnosticism — an attestation-service outage must not flip the attested index stale). Fresh-but-unattested is the normal state (NR-7): no warning, no error. **(4) No-blending rule:** no combined effective-staleness scalar; attestation validity never folded into `expires`; no single published trust ordering between stale-but-attested and fresh-but-unattested (a policy MAY require fresh, attested, both, or neither). Informative: the stale+attested combination warrants the stronger consumer diagnostic — staleness is the window in which an upstream-revoked attestation still reads valid (revocation feed is Decision #33 roadmap). **(5) Lane:** staleness = state-flag + SHOULD-warn, install MAY proceed; installers MUST provide an operator opt-in escalating to MUST-refuse; never silent-block by default, never silent-ignore. **Anti-laundering holds behaviorally:** both checks run independently, so neither axis can mask the other — most-restrictive-wins is delivered without any combined value existing; the freeze surface (re-crawls advancing `fetched_at` for unchanged content) is covered on the attestation axis, where the consumer's own validity evaluation sees the lapse. **Zero new fields** (the schema already carries everything — itself evidence of the right shape). Roadmap valve: OPTIONAL informative `attestation_valid_until` mirror for offline consumers ("MUST NOT be a staleness input"), spec-purist's dissent preserved with his absence semantics as the recorded design. Mini-review: spec-purist + registry-operator; first resolution adopted under Holden's standing delegation. **Test vectors:** TV-FRESH-* family (Appendix B). See `panel/freshness-consensus.md`. |
| 35 | Registry §10.4 redirect composition: permanent-prefix rule | Mixed redirect chains were underdetermined — the per-hop rules conflicted for `A →302→ B →301→ C` (temporary rule: record A; permanent rule: record C), filed during the conformance-runner build (reference adapter carried an interim last-permanent-anywhere behavior with a comment admitting the gap). **Resolution:** the recorded value is the request URL of the **first temporary redirect** in the chain; if no temporary redirect, the final resolved URL — equivalently, the crawl-seed advanced through consecutive leading permanent redirects and frozen at the first temporary hop; downstream permanents MUST NOT affect the record. Three properties fall out by construction: (1) a compromised temporary hop (CDN edge, LB) can never choose the recorded host — the injection class is eliminated, not policed; (2) per-crawl delivery churn can never move `source_uri` — the stability-invariant guard becomes structural (empty permanent prefix ⟺ recorded == normalized requested URL), well-defined for every chain shape including no-temp chains where the old "no permanent redirect observed" wording was ambiguous; (3) the record-time re-dereference bullet reduces to an assertable outcome (recorded URL's crawl response was final or temporary — never permanent), so no post-crawl re-fetch and no new error identifier. Freeze governs recording only, never traversal: downgrade/loop/limit checks apply to every hop, before and after the freeze, and a reject on any hop rejects the record. **§10.6 deliberately decoupled** (over spec-purist's prefix-scoping objection, on registry-operator's argument): `moved` fires on a permanent observed anywhere in the chain, so a migration behind a temp-fronting CDN stays visible on the status axis instead of being silently pinned — same never-blend philosophy as Decision #34. **Rejected:** last-permanent-anywhere — persists identity assertions made about ephemeral delivery URLs, forfeits re-crawl stability under varying temp detours, and makes every `source_uri` change unattributable (real move vs. downstream noise). Residuals named informatively in §10.4: origin self-assertion onto an uncontrolled host or capability-carrying path (pre-existing property of honoring 301/308, bounded by provenance-never-identity), and the 301↔302-toggling entry hop (publisher misconfiguration; `moved` still fires). Mini-review: spec-purist + valsorda + registry-operator, all ADOPT-WITH-CHANGES, changes applied; adopted under Holden's standing delegation, 2026-07-13. **Test vectors:** TV-URI-w (temp-then-permanent freeze), TV-URI-x (prefix endpoint, not crawl-seed), TV-URI-y (consecutive permanents fold; 308), TV-URI-z (perm-temp-perm sandwich), TV-URI-m2 (post-freeze downgrade), TV-URI-l3 (303) — landed with the clarification. |

**Registries MUST NOT write to source files.** All registry-generated metadata lives in sidecars only.

**Forbidden item-record fields** (Decision #16): `effective_version`, `derived_version`, `pack_inherited_version`, `resolved_version`. These MUST NOT appear in either `publisher_section` or `registry_section` on item records. They MAY appear on pack records under the appropriate semantics (a pack's `version` is its own, not inherited).

## Open Questions

| # | Status | Question |
|---|---|---|
| OQ-1 | **Resolved** | Sidecar binding uses `body_hash` as the identity key. Single-file items: hash of the content file. Multi-file items: MOAT directory hash (Decision #19). Two hooks on the same event have different script bodies → different hashes → unambiguous binding. |
| OQ-2 | **Resolved** | Content hash boundary for multi-file items: ACIF adopts the MOAT v0.4.0 content-hash algorithm verbatim. Closed `TEXT_EXTENSIONS` set, NUL-byte binary detection, BOM/CRLF normalization for text, VCS directories excluded, symlinks rejected at ingestion. Registry-generated sidecar files inside the content directory are excluded at root only (circular-dependency guard, analog of MOAT's `moat-attestation.json` rule). See Decision #19. |
| OQ-3 | **Resolved** | Pack model — `kind: pack` L2 record with stable UUID identity. Two paths: registry-inferred (Option C primary, via v0.1 inference algorithm) and publisher-declared (Option A opt-in). Declared wins on conflict. Pack-less items are first-class. See Decision #18 and `panel/pack-model-consensus.md`. |
| OQ-4 | **Resolved** | No version inheritance into item records. Item `version` is literal-or-absent. Pack `version` lives on pack record only. `body_hash` is the canonical per-item change signal, surfaced normatively to all consumers. See Decisions #16, #17 and `panel/pack-model-consensus.md`. |
| OQ-5 | **Addressed** | Registry transparency: `publisher_declared` (bool, REQUIRED) + `publisher_metadata` (enum, OPTIONAL INFORMATIVE). See registry section schema above. |
| OQ-6 | **Resolved** | `os`/`arch` absence semantics → **Decision #33** (platform_commands panel, folded in by pre-panel selection). `os` absent = **unconstrained** (matches all enum members) — the "unspecified" reading has no implemented consumer behavior; every provider's single-command mechanism IS the unconstrained default. Absent is NOT rewritten to the full enumeration (distinct canonical bytes); `os: []` ≠ absent (matches nothing → reject). `arch` identical semantics but excluded from selection in v0.1 (advisory). See `panel/platform-commands-consensus.md` §1. |
| OQ-7 | **CLOSED (all six walks resolved)** | `requires` vocabulary — Decision #23 establishes the principle (three-way disposition: DERIVABLE / OUT-OF-SCOPE-AT-L1 / `requires`-ELIGIBLE; predicate-explicit derivability `D_K`; tiebreaker rule; empty-as-steady-state; three-valued unknown-key logic; orphan-key reject for cross-type scoping). **MCP slice resolved:** `mcp.requires` empty/absent for v0.1 (all 8 Syllago canonical keys DERIVABLE by `D_K` over `servers.*`). **Agents slice resolved:** `agents.requires` empty/absent for v0.1 (5 of 7 Syllago canonical keys DERIVABLE, 2 OUT-OF-SCOPE-AT-L1). **Hooks slice resolved:** `hooks.requires` empty/absent for v0.1 (3 of 9 Syllago canonical keys DERIVABLE — `handler_types`, `matcher_patterns`, `async_execution`; 6 OUT-OF-SCOPE-AT-L1 — `hook_scopes` install-location plus five script-runtime keys under the new script-body opacity sub-rationale; runtime hints deferred to roadmap). First non-unanimous panel (3:1); Position A — empty-`requires` for v0.1 — adopted. New normative scaffolding from hooks walk: Decision #29 (canonical hook event vocab + handler-type enum pinning), D_K boolean discipline normative in Decision #23, two new registry projections (`event_provider_coverage`, `install_scope_capabilities`). **Skills slice resolved:** `skills.requires` empty/absent for v0.1 (4 of 15 Syllago canonical keys DERIVABLE — `auto_invocable`, `disable_model_invocation`, `user_invocable`, `skill_bundled_resources`; 11 OUT-OF-SCOPE-AT-L1). Unanimous result with amendment menu (contrast hooks' 3:1 split). New normative scaffolding from skills walk: Decision #19 amendment (content-type-general single/multi-file classification predicate), Decision #21 amendment (`activation.user_invocable` + canonicalization-time default materialization), Strict whitespace rule for `D_K` string predicates, `install_scope_capabilities` provenance tags, reciprocal skill-side `cross_references`. **Rules slice resolved (the load-bearing test):** `rules.requires` empty/absent for v0.1 (1 of 5 Syllago canonical keys DERIVABLE — `activation_mode`, positive-set `D_K` over the Decision #30 enum; 4 OUT-OF-SCOPE-AT-L1 — `file_imports` under prose-body opacity [the strongest requires-candidate surfaced; coupled to unified OQ-8], `cross_provider_recognition`, `auto_memory`, `hierarchical_loading` [→ `provider_capability_coverage`]). **First 2:2 panel split of the series** (Remy/Karpathy REJECT vs spec-purist/registry-operator ADMIT on `file_imports`); resolved by Holden to REJECT on reversibility asymmetry, adoption empirics, and OQ-8 coherence. New normative scaffolding from the rules walk: Decision #30 (Rule Extension Block + first ACIF-owned vocabulary — activation-mode enum with total mapping table), the out-of-band eligibility guardrail in Decision #23 (standing test for all future walks), `provider_capability_coverage` registry projection, bounded-globs projection discipline. Predicate-pinning-debt ledger did NOT advance (all rules scaffolds ruled core-primitive). Empty-as-steady-state holds **five-for-five** — via the hard route: the strawman deliberately proposed the first eligible key, and the resolution was on the merits, not by principle-preservation. **Commands slice resolved — OQ-7 CLOSED (six-for-six, validated):** `commands.requires` empty/absent for v0.1 (0 of 2 Syllago canonical keys DERIVABLE; 2 OUT-OF-SCOPE-AT-L1 — `argument_substitution` under body-content opacity [the proposed body-token `D_K` rejected 3:1 via the derivation-vs-heuristic refinement; body signal ships as an advisory projection, provider signal via `provider_capability_coverage`], `builtin_commands` provider-matrix [HIGH shadowing-severity finding recorded]). New scaffolding from the commands walk: Decision #31 (Command Extension Block + second ACIF-owned vocabulary — argument-placeholder rewrite), the derivation-vs-heuristic refinement, the three-way routing statement (body → derivable/opaque; provider → matrix; user-environment → requires), the advisory registry tier. Predicate-pinning-debt ledger CLOSED unadvanced: across all six walks exactly one requires-adjacent scaffold (skills' activation-default materialization), and the final walk's emptiness is robust under scaffold removal. The `requires` slot is reserved, not vestigial — predicted first tenant: runtime hints (roadmap). Contingencies recorded: OQ-8 never-parse branch re-hears the rules dissent; OQ-10 promotions must respect the routing; runtime hints landing is the intended non-empty future, not a regression. Empirical grounding: round 2 found hook libraries in six runtimes; rules walk 10-provider matrix (6 activation sub-modes); commands walk 10-provider matrix (argument_substitution 6/10, builtin_commands 6/10 — the by-content-type aggregate was stale at 4 providers; per-provider files authoritative). |
| OQ-8 | **Resolved for v0.1 (never-parse); grammar question roadmap-deferred with owner** | **v0.1 answer (adopted 2026-07-11):** ACIF v0.1's capability layer reads canonical structured content only; body content — @-references, argument-placeholder tokens, injection directives — is uniformly opaque to the disposition layer (this normatively adopts the commands walk's standing rule as OQ-8's v0.1 answer). Heuristic body signals ship only on the advisory tier (Decision #23 derivation-vs-heuristic refinement). **This is NOT a permanent never-parse ruling** — the structured-grammar question moves to ROADMAP.md ("Body-content reference grammar") carrying all pre-recorded obligations: the structured-record bar, the OP-COND-RULES-4/-5 @-import lints, rules' `file_imports` DERIVABLE-on-grammar path, and **spec-purist's preserved rules dissent, which MUST be re-heard by whoever finalizes the never-parse branch permanently**. Original question and full pre-recorded structure follow for the roadmap owner. — Does ACIF's capability layer ever read body content, and if so, under what structure? Now spans: skills' `@sibling.md` referencing (in-bundle; `examples/obra/skill-tdd.md`), rules' `@path` imports (amp documents relative/absolute/`~/` paths — frequently out-of-bundle, invisible to `body_hash`), commands' argument-placeholder tokens (`$ARGUMENTS` — Decision #31 normalizes the token but the capability layer does not derive from it), and injection directives (gemini `!{...}` shell / `@{...}` file). Bundling is resolved (Decision #19); body-content parsing is not. **The structured-record bar (commands walk):** "grammar pinned" legitimizes derivation only if the canonicalizer resolves body content into a structured canonical record (e.g., an `imports[]` array) that a predicate reads correct-by-construction — a grammar that merely recognizes patterns leaves any scan a heuristic → advisory tier at most (Decision #23 derivation-vs-heuristic refinement). **Resolution consequences pre-recorded:** structured-grammar branch → rules `file_imports` becomes DERIVABLE and the deferred OP-COND-RULES-4/-5 lints (@-target classes `{in-bundle, absolute, home, url}` — exfil/remote-fetch hazard) become implementable; never-parse branch → spec-purist's preserved rules dissent (silent semantic corruption) MUST be re-heard before finalizing. In no branch does any body-carried capability become `requires`-eligible (out-of-band guardrail + three-way routing). See `panel/commands-requires-consensus.md` §5, `panel/rules-requires-consensus.md` §5/§9, `panel/skills-requires-consensus.md` §6. |
| OQ-9 | **Resolved** | Two-tier freshness → **Decision #34** (mini-review: spec-purist + registry-operator, 2026-07-11 — the OQ-11 pair). Neither expiry "takes precedence" — the question dissolved: freshness (crawl axis, `fetched_at`/`expires`, consumer-time predicate, warn-default) and attestation validity (trust tier, consumer-evaluated under the external system's own rules) are **orthogonal axes that are never combined**. The strawman's `min()` was rejected from both directions (no ACIF field carries an attestation expiry → untestable; vacuous for log-based attestations, refresh-storm for cert-window ones). Anti-laundering holds behaviorally: independent checks mean neither axis can mask the other. Registry responses MUST be byte-identical regardless of attestation-system reachability. Zero new fields. The OP-COND-URI-5 dependency (stable `source_uri`) is satisfied by Decision #32 and closes. Roadmap valve: informative `attestation_valid_until` mirror. See `panel/freshness-consensus.md`. |
| OQ-10 | **Roadmap-deferred with owner (2026-07-11)** | Latent-field promotion is NOT needed for v0.1 — transport ≠ promotion already works (passthrough carries the fields 1:1; the orphan-key reject stays hard; latent-field presence MUST NOT soften it). Moved to ROADMAP.md ("Latent-field promotion") carrying the recorded obligations below. Original question: latent-field promotion — should `SkillMeta`'s `AllowedTools` / `DisallowedTools` / `Model` / bundled `Hooks` AND `CommandMeta`'s `AllowedTools` / `Model` / `Agent` / `Effort` / `Context` / `DisableModelInvocation` / `UserInvocable` be promoted to canonical capability vocabulary? Until resolved, all are out-of-scope in Decision #23's applications and their presence MUST NOT soften the orphan-key reject. **Uniformity constraint (commands walk):** when activation-adjacent fields are promoted, commands' `UserInvocable`/`DisableModelInvocation` and skills' equivalents MUST be disposed uniformly — same representation, same `D_K` shape (six-types-co-equal forbids a user-invocability signal installers parse two ways). **Promotion obligations recorded:** `allowed_tools` MUST use Decision #25's vocabulary (no second tool vocabulary); commands' `agent` is a latent name-based cross-type reference — promotion requires resolving name-vs-UUID against Decision #21's pattern (Decision #28 input); `effort` needs a #30/#31-style enum+mapping if promoted. OP-COND-SKILLS-5 remains roadmap-coupled here. See `panel/skills-requires-consensus.md` §7, `panel/commands-requires-consensus.md` §7. |
| OQ-11 | **Resolved** | `source_uri` normative tightening → **Decision #32**. Resolved 2026-07-10 by the project's first two-reviewer mini-review (spec-purist + registry-operator; the format the OQ row predicted). Of the surviving six-point summary: RFC 3986 baseline and fragment-strip adopted clean; percent-encoding amended (§6.2.2 alone was incomplete — §6.2.3 and intra-section ordering added); https-only restructured as a closed scheme allowlist (v0.1 content exactly `{https}`); last-path-segment amended (conflict → record both + diagnostic, never silent override); **post-redirect final-URL recording REJECTED** on registry-operator's scale evidence (signed expiring asset URLs, delivery-host churn, geo divergence) and replaced with 301/308-only canonical resolution. Query strings forbidden entirely (credential class eliminated by construction). New: identity firewall, re-crawl stability invariant, `source_status` field, A.3 case-scoping reconciliation, OQ-9 dependency note, TV-URI-* family (unblocks TV-11+). Four splits resolved by Holden, all to the operationally-grounded position. See `panel/source-uri-consensus.md`. |

## Appendix A — Inference Algorithm v0.1 (normative)

Registries that emit `registry_section.inferred_pack_id` MUST follow this algorithm. Half-normative inference ("MAY infer however documented") is explicitly rejected — either implement v0.1 exactly, or omit `inferred_pack_id` entirely.

### A.1 — Canonical source precedence

When a repo contains multiple pack-shaped manifests, registries select the canonical source by this precedence:

1. `package.json` (top-level `name` field)
2. `.claude-plugin/plugin.json` (top-level `name` field)
3. `.cursor-plugin/plugin.json` (top-level `name` field)
4. `.codex-plugin/plugin.json` (top-level `name` field)
5. `gemini-extension.json` (top-level `name` field)
6. **Directory-adjacency fallback** — repo's basename from `repository_url`

The first present source wins. When multiple manifests exist, conflicting values produce a registry warning (surfaced to the publisher); the precedence chain resolves which value the registry adopts as canonical.

### A.2 — Canonical `display_name`

`canonical_display_name = trim(source.name)` from the highest-precedence source. No case-folding, no whitespace collapsing beyond a single leading/trailing trim. If the source's `name` field is absent or empty, fall back to the next source.

### A.3 — Canonical `repository_url`

`canonical_repository_url` is the lowercased, https-normalized, trailing-slash-stripped, `.git`-suffix-stripped form of the repo's fetch URL. Examples:

- `git@github.com:obra/superpowers.git` → `https://github.com/obra/superpowers`
- `https://github.com/obra/superpowers/` → `https://github.com/obra/superpowers`

> **Scope note (Decision #32):** this whole-URL lowercasing deliberately collapses observed-casing variance into one repository identity for pack inference, and is **scoped to pack inference only** — it is technically wrong for case-sensitive paths in the general case (a documented, accepted identity-collapse hazard). The `source_uri` normalization (Decision #32) lowercases scheme + host only and preserves path case; the two pipelines serve different contracts and MUST NOT share an implementation.

### A.4 — `inferred_pack_id` derivation

```
inferred_pack_id = UUIDv5(
  namespace = ACIF_PACK_NAMESPACE,
  name      = canonical_repository_url + "\n" + canonical_display_name
)
```

Where `ACIF_PACK_NAMESPACE` is the spec-pinned literal UUID:

```
ACIF_PACK_NAMESPACE = "93516344-00e5-419b-a230-6e8b1d02f87d"
```

> **PINNED 2026-07-11** (closes registry-operator's OP-COND-1): a fresh UUIDv4 generated by the spec authors, documented as the canonical namespace for inference algorithm v0.1, never reused for any other algorithm version. A future inference algorithm version MUST generate and pin its own namespace constant. Reference computation (TV-3): `UUIDv5(ACIF_PACK_NAMESPACE, "https://github.com/obra/superpowers\nsuperpowers")` = `d932cd6d-1c14-527d-b2e7-185c717b7a0d`.

### A.5 — Canonical address derivation

`canonical_address = <owner>/<canonical_display_name>` where `owner` is extracted from `canonical_repository_url`:

- **github.com:** `owner = path segment after host`
- **gitlab.com:** `owner = path segment after host` (may be a group; full group path joined with `/`)
- **bitbucket.org:** `owner = path segment after host`
- **git.sr.ht:** `owner = first path segment, with leading `~` stripped`
- **Other hosts:** `owner = first path segment of canonical_repository_url`

### A.6 — Inference version field

Every registry response containing `inferred_pack_id` MUST include `inference_version: "v0.1"` in the same `registry_section`. Consumers detecting inference-version drift between registries SHOULD treat it as a divergence signal.

## Appendix B — Conformance Test Vectors (required for v0.1 ship)

The spec MUST publish these test vectors in a `conformance/` directory. Two implementations agreeing in prose but diverging in bytes is the failure mode these vectors prevent.

| ID | Tests | Description |
|---|---|---|
| TV-1 | `body_hash` stability across pack context | Same skill body bytes, three pack contexts (pack-less / pack-A / pack-B) → identical `body_hash.value` |
| TV-2 | `metadata_hash` invariance under PATH α | Same publisher frontmatter, different inferred pack contexts → identical `metadata_hash.value` |
| TV-3 | `inferred_pack_id` determinism | `repository_url=https://github.com/obra/superpowers` + `display_name=superpowers` → reference UUIDv5 `d932cd6d-1c14-527d-b2e7-185c717b7a0d` (under the pinned `ACIF_PACK_NAMESPACE = 93516344-00e5-419b-a230-6e8b1d02f87d`, Appendix A.4) |
| TV-4 | Declared wins over inferred | Item with `publisher_section.pack_id=X` + `registry_section.inferred_pack_id=Y` (X≠Y) → consumer resolves via X |
| TV-5 | Unresolvable `pack_id` semantics | Item with `publisher_section.pack_id=Z` where Z does not exist → `pack_resolution="unresolved"`; install MUST refuse |
| TV-6 | Forbidden field set | Sidecar with `effective_version` on an item → conformance error |
| TV-7 | Literal version preserved through pack context | Item declares `version=2.0.0`, pack declares `version=5.1.0` → `publisher_section.version=2.0.0` (literal, unchanged); no item-level field reflects 5.1.0 |
| TV-8 | Pack-less item is first-class | Item with no `pack_id` and no `inferred_pack_id` → valid sidecar, installable |
| TV-9 | Canonical `metadata_hash` byte string | Given a `publisher_section` JSON, canonical serialization (UTF-8 JSON, sorted keys, no whitespace, LF) matches published byte string → `metadata_hash` matches published reference hash |
| TV-10 | Pack rename preserves identity (should-have) | Pack with `id=UUID` renamed `display_name` → `id` unchanged; existing item references via `pack_id` continue to resolve |
| TV-MCP-* | MCP canonicalization & requires-emptiness family (Decision #23, #24) | Family covers: (a) default `type` materialization — stdio when only `command`, streamable-http when only `url`; (b) ambiguous rejection (both `command` and `url` with no `type`) → `acif.mcp.transport_default_ambiguous`; (c) undetermined rejection (neither) → `acif.mcp.transport_default_undetermined`; (d) `body_hash` stability across no-type/explicit-type round-trips; (e) `mcp.requires` empty-or-absent is conformant; (f) unknown `requires.<key>` → three-valued `unknown` evaluation; (g) `requires.transport_types` (or any other derivable key) appearing on an `mcp_config` item → non-conformant (orphan-key reject under per-content-type vocab scoping). Individual TV IDs to be enumerated when the conformance suite is authored. |
| TV-AGENT-* | Agents `requires` empty-state + derivability predicate family (Decision #23, #25) | Family covers: (a) `agents.requires` empty-or-absent is conformant (empty-as-steady-state, Decision #23); (b) unknown `requires.<key>` on an agent item → three-valued `unknown` evaluation; (c) any DERIVABLE key (e.g., `requires.tool_restrictions`) appearing on an `agents` item → non-conformant (orphan-key reject under per-content-type vocab scoping); (d) `D_K: tool_restrictions` — canonical body with `Tools: [Read]` produces derivable-true; empty `Tools` + empty `DisallowedTools` produces derivable-false; (e) `D_K: model_selection` over `Model` — non-empty → derivable-true; empty → derivable-false; (f) `D_K: per_agent_mcp` over `MCPServers` — same shape; (g) `D_K: subagent_spawning` over `Tools` — `Tools: ["agent"]` produces derivable-true; `Tools: ["Read", "Edit"]` produces derivable-false (exercises Decision #25 canonical-tool-name pinning); (h) canonical `Tools` array contains spec-pinned neutral names (`agent`, not `Agent`/`Task`/`spawn_agent`); `body_hash` is computed post-translation; renderers MAY translate to provider-specific names at render time. Individual TV IDs to be enumerated when the conformance suite is authored. |
| TV-HOOK-* | Hooks `requires` empty-state + derivability predicate family (Decision #23, #29) | Family covers: (a) `hooks.requires` empty-or-absent is conformant (empty-as-steady-state, Decision #23); (b) any key (e.g., `requires.handler_types`) appearing on a `hooks` item → non-conformant (orphan-key reject under per-content-type vocab scoping); (c) unknown `requires.<key>` on a hook item → three-valued `unknown` evaluation; (d) `D_K: handler_types` — canonical body with `Hooks: [{Type: "command", Command: "..."}]` produces derivable-true; empty `Hooks` REJECTS with `acif.hook.handlers_missing` (amended at spec promotion: `handlers` is required-nonempty in [ACIF-HOOK] §6.2, so the derivable-false branch is unreachable on valid input — the vector tests the reject, and the predicate is a constant-true disposition); closed enum `{command, http, prompt, agent}` is normative per Decision #29; (e) `D_K: matcher_patterns` over `Matcher` — non-empty → derivable-true; empty → derivable-false; (f) `D_K: async_execution` over `Hooks[*].Async` — at least one `Async: true` → derivable-true; all `Async: false` (or absent) → derivable-false; (g) canonical event-name round-trip — provider-specific event names are translated to the pinned canonical vocabulary at canonicalize time; `body_hash` is computed post-translation (exercises Decision #29); (h) canonical handler-type round-trip — provider-specific handler-type names are translated to the pinned canonical enum at canonicalize time (exercises Decision #29). Individual TV IDs to be enumerated when the conformance suite is authored. |
| TV-COMMAND-* | Commands canonicalization + `requires` empty-state + Decision #31 family (Decision #23, #31) | Family covers: (a) placeholder canonicalization — `{{args}}` → `$ARGUMENTS`; identity forms; `body_hash` computed post-rewrite; render-back to gemini (`{{args}}`) and VS Code (`${input:args}`); render-back to non-supporting targets (windsurf/cline) carries `$ARGUMENTS` verbatim + warning; (b) lossy named-var collapse — `${input:filename}` and `${input:message}` → same canonical body → **identical `body_hash`**; `acif.command.placeholder_named_arg_collapsed` diagnostic emitted; render-back non-identity documented; (c) token boundary — `$ARGUMENTS` → recognized; `$ARGUMENTS[0]` → recognized (`[` boundary); `$ARGUMENTSFOO` → NOT recognized; end-of-body → recognized; (d) fenced-code behavior — token inside a code fence treated identically to outside (non-markdown-aware, pinned so implementers don't diverge; the advisory projection's disclosed false-positive); (e) no-escape-literal — literal-intent `$ARGUMENTS` is still the placeholder (no escape mechanism in v0.1); (f) unrecognized positional — body with only `$1`/`${@:N}` → carried verbatim, no rewrite, no advisory signal (disclosed false-negative); (g) gemini directives out of scope — `!{shell}` / `@{file}` → not placeholders, carried verbatim (anti-shoehorn pin); (h) frontmatter stripped from `body_hash` — same body, different `model`/`allowed_tools` → identical `body_hash` (Decision #12); (i) `command.requires` empty-or-absent is conformant; (j) orphan-key reject, four distinct reject reasons — `requires.argument_substitution` (considered-and-disposed), `requires.builtin_commands` (OOS key), `requires.handler_types` (foreign-type), `requires.disable_model_invocation` (latent CommandMeta match — presence MUST NOT soften); (k) unknown `requires.<key>` → three-valued `unknown`; (l) *(conditional)* builtin-shadowing diagnostic — custom command named `/compact` → registry MAY emit collision advisory; vector tests the diagnostic shape if emitted, not whether emitted. Individual TV IDs to be enumerated when the conformance suite is authored. |
| TV-RULE-* | Rules canonicalization + `requires` empty-state + Decision #30 family (Decision #23, #30) | Family covers: (a) activation-default materialization — activation block absent → canonical form carries `mode: always`; `body_hash` computed post-materialization (parallel to TV-MCP-*/TV-SKILL-*); (b) mode required-when-present — block present, `mode` absent → `acif.rule.activation_mode_missing`; (c) invalid value — `mode: sometimes` AND `mode: " always"` (exact byte-match membership, no trim) → `acif.rule.activation_mode_invalid`; (d) mapping-table totality — `frontmatter_globs`-declared source → `glob`; windsurf `trigger: manual` → `manual`; zed slash-command rule → `manual`; legacy `AlwaysApply=false`+no-globs → `model_decision` (deterministic residual); unmapped provider mode → `acif.rule.activation_mode_unmappable` (exercises Decision #30); (e) glob consistency — `mode: glob` without `globs` → `acif.rule.glob_mode_without_globs`; `globs` with `mode ≠ glob` → `acif.rule.globs_without_glob_mode`; (f) `D_K: activation_mode` — `always` → derivable-false; `glob`/`model_decision`/`manual` → derivable-true; activation-absent → derivable-false via materialization (exercises the positive-set form); (g) `derived_capabilities` projection carries `{derivable, mode, globs bounded per OP-COND-RULES-2}`; (h) `rule.requires` empty-or-absent is conformant (empty-as-steady-state); (i) orphan-key reject, three distinct reject reasons — `requires.file_imports` (the considered-and-rejected candidate; its rejection is load-bearing), `requires.activation_mode` (derivable keys are never `requires` keys), `requires.handler_types` (foreign-type key) — all non-conformant on a rule; (j) unknown `requires.<key>` → three-valued `unknown` evaluation; (k) prose-opacity round-trip — body containing `@`-import syntax canonicalizes and renders back with prose carried verbatim (ACIF does not parse @-references in v0.1); `body_hash` stable. Individual TV IDs to be enumerated when the conformance suite is authored. |
| TV-SKILL-* | Skills `requires` empty-state + derivability + amendment-exercising family (Decision #23, and the #19/#21 amendments) | Family covers: (a) `skills.requires` empty-or-absent is conformant (empty-as-steady-state, Decision #23); (b) orphan-key reject — any `requires.<key>` on a skill → non-conformant, including a key recognized in another type (`requires.handler_types`) AND a key matching a latent `SkillMeta` field (`requires.tool_restrictions`); latent-field presence MUST NOT soften the reject; (c) unknown `requires.<key>` → three-valued `unknown` evaluation; (d) `D_K: auto_invocable` — activation absent (→true), `type: auto` (→true), `type: manual` (→false), `type: hook` (→false); (e) `D_K: disable_model_invocation` — absent (default auto → false), `type: auto` (→false), `type: manual` (→true), `type: hook` (→true); (f) `D_K: user_invocable` — absent (default true → false), `user_invocable: true` (→false), `user_invocable: false` (→true); exercises the Decision #21 amendment; (g) `D_K: skill_bundled_resources` — single-file `SKILL.md` (→false); dir with `SKILL.md` only (→false); dir with `SKILL.md`+`LICENSE`+`README` (→false, exclusion list); dir with `SKILL.md`+`scripts/` (→true); exercises the Decision #19 classification amendment; (h) activation-default materialization — activation absent → canonicalized form carries `type: auto` and `user_invocable: true`; `body_hash` computed post-materialization (parallel to TV-MCP-*); (i) body classification (general) — directory with only `{LICENSE, README}` beyond the entry file → single-file; directory with a co-located content file → multi-file; applies to skills AND bundled-script hooks (content-type-general Decision #19 predicate); (j) hook-activated skill cross-reference — `type: hook` + `hook_ref.id` → registry resolves per Decision #28 enum AND emits the reciprocal skill-side `cross_references` entry (OP-COND-SKILLS-4).

| TV-URI-* | `source_uri` normalization + validation family (Decision #32; occupies the TV-11+ slot) | Two harness surfaces, both required — conformance MUST NOT be claimed on the static vectors alone. **Static string vectors:** (a) case normalization — `HTTPS://GitHub.IO/A%3ab` → `https://github.io/A%3Ab` (scheme+host folded, percent-hex uppercased, path case preserved); (b) decode-unreserved — `a%2Db%7Ec` → `a-b~c`; (c) reserved-not-decoded — `%2F` unchanged; (d) ordered encoded-dot-segment — `/x/%2E%2E/y` → `/y` (pins the decode-then-collapse order; the cross-registry divergence + path-traversal hazard); (e) literal dot-segments — `/a/./b/../c` → `/c`; (f) default-port removal — `:443` stripped, `:8443` kept; (g) empty-path → `/`; (h) fragment stripped; (i) query prohibition — emitted record with `?token=x` → `acif.source_uri.query_present`; dangling `?` removed; (j) scheme gate — `http://` → `acif.source_uri.scheme_forbidden`; `git@github.com:o/r.git` → `acif.source_uri.malformed`; `javascript:`/`data:`/`file:` → `scheme_forbidden`; (k) userinfo → `acif.source_uri.userinfo_present`; (o) direct-file last segment — single-file item + `.../my-skill.md` ⇒ Decision #22 tier-2 fallback name `my-skill`; (o′) filename conflict — URL-derived ≠ frontmatter name ⇒ both recorded + `acif.source_uri.filename_conflict`, no silent override; (p) single-file trailing slash → `acif.source_uri.direct_file_trailing_slash`; (q) multi-file directory URL — trailing slash conformant, no filename semantics; (r) idempotency — `normalize(normalize(u)) == normalize(u)` byte-for-byte; (s) hash exclusion — identical body, different `source_uri` ⇒ identical `body_hash` AND `metadata_hash` (parallels TV-1). **Mock-transport vectors:** (l) permanent resolution — 301 ⇒ target recorded; (l′) temporary preservation — 302 to a signed URL ⇒ requested URL recorded, signed query never persisted; (m) downgrade — hop to `http://` → `acif.source_uri.redirect_downgrade`; (n) chain > `ACIF_SOURCE_URI_MAX_REDIRECTS` or loop → `acif.source_uri.redirect_limit`; *(Decision #35 composition additions:)* (l″) 303 temporary-class representative ⇒ requested URL recorded; (m′) downgrade after the freeze point still rejects; (w) temp-then-permanent — downstream permanent never affects the record; (x) permanent-prefix endpoint recorded, not the crawl-seed; (y) consecutive permanents fold to the final resolved URL (308 representative); (z) perm-temp-perm sandwich records the prefix endpoint; (t) re-crawl stability — same body twice through a temporary-redirect chain ⇒ byte-identical `source_uri`; (u) *(conditional)* `source_status` shape — if emitted, value ∈ `{live, moved, gone, unreachable}`.

| TV-PLATFORM-* | Per-OS script selection, canonicalization mapping, and hash coverage (Decision #33; #6/#19 amended; type-general — separate from the requires-scoped TV-HOOK-*) | Family covers: (a) absence=all — os-absent entry selected on all three OS when no constrained match (OQ-6); (b) constrained-beats-default — default + `os:[windows]`: tagged runs on windows, default on linux; (c) empty-list rejects — `os: []` → `acif.hook.script_os_empty`; `arch: []` → `script_arch_empty`; (d) invalid values — `os:[linux, freebsd]` and `os:[Linux]` (exact byte, no fold) → `acif.hook.script_os_invalid`; (e) default ambiguity — two os-absent entries → `acif.hook.script_default_ambiguous`; (f) constrained overlap — `os:[linux,darwin]` + `os:[linux]` → `acif.hook.script_platform_ambiguous`, diagnostic names `linux` + entry indices (fix-forward); (g) disjoint set passes; (g′) decoy accept — one default + one `os:[windows]` → ACCEPT (selection determinism ≠ divergence safety, pinned deliberately); (h) no-match no-default → defined no-op + `acif.hook.script_no_platform_match`; (i) HIF map canonicalization — `command`+3-key `platform{}` → 4 entries (3 singleton constrained + default), disjoint by construction, `body_hash` post-mapping; (j) osx rename — `"osx"` never in canonical form; (k) copilot-cli collapse — `bash`→`[linux,darwin]`, `powershell`→`[windows]` + MUST `acif.hook.platform_shell_os_proxy` + provenance `inferred-from-convention`; (l) cline extension table — `.ps1`/`.cmd`/`.bat`→`[windows]`, extensionless→`[linux,darwin]`, `.xyz` → default + `platform_filename_uninferable`; negative: extensionless pwsh-shebang file infers unix (disclosed false mapping); (m) claude-code `shell:` exclusion — no os synthesized; render-back structured-encodes an injection-shaped passthrough value (proves no string-splice); (n) unmapped mechanism → `acif.hook.platform_unmappable`; (o) render-back drop — default emitted, constrained dropped, MUST `acif.hook.platform_override_dropped`; (p) no-default render — matching entry when target OS declared, else refuse `acif.hook.no_default_for_degraded_render`; (q) **hash coverage (fails pre-#33 — the enforcing vector)** — flipping one `os` tag with script bytes unchanged MUST move `body_hash` and the Decision #17 tuple-endpoint value; flipping `shell:` likewise; (q′) determinism (spec-promotion addition) — sources differing only in `os` tag order, `scripts[]` entry order, or inline-content line endings → byte-identical canonical form and identical `body_hash` ([ACIF-HOOK] §7.1/§9.3); (r) round-trip — HIF `command`+platform → ACIF → HIF identity modulo documented-lossy cases; dead-default preserved (not stripped); (s) `os_coverage` projection — one entry `os:[linux,darwin,windows]` → `os_divergent: false` vs three per-OS entries → `true` with identical `os` sets (proves the boolean is load-bearing); provenance per pinned predicates; (t) install coverage-gap — `blocking:true` + `os:[linux,darwin]` only on a Windows target → MUST-refuse; `blocking:false` → SHOULD-warn + defined no-op. Individual TV IDs to be enumerated when the conformance suite is authored. |
| TV-FRESH-* | Two-tier freshness orthogonality family (Decision #34) | Static vectors (fixed instants, injected consumer clock `T`) plus one mock-crawl vector. Family covers: (a) sidecar past + attestation valid → crawl axis STALE, tier ATTESTED, default policy WARNS (not refuse), no combined scalar anywhere in the record; (b) sidecar fresh + attestation lapsed → crawl axis FRESH, tier degrades to UNATTESTED, staleness bit NOT set; (c) `attestation_hash` present + manifest unreachable → tier UNATTESTED, crawl freshness unaffected, registry response **byte-identical** to the reachable case (CDN-safety/outage-decoupling pin); (d) `expires` absent → `fetched_at + 72h` default; `T` at +71h fresh, +73h stale; (e) `expires < fetched_at` → `acif.registry.expires_before_fetched_at` (malformed, fix-forward) vs legitimately-already-past `expires` → well-formed, stale, conforming to serve; (f) offsetless/non-UTC timestamp in any freshness field → malformed (RFC 3339 explicit offset REQUIRED); (g) fail-closed skew — `T` within the declared tolerance of `E_sidecar` ⇒ stale; (h) lanes — stale item, default policy → SHOULD-warn + state-flag, install proceeds; operator freshness-enforcement opt-in → MUST-refuse; (i) fresh-but-unattested → no staleness warning, no attestation error (NR-7); (j) *(mock-crawl)* unchanged `body_hash`, `fetched_at` advanced → crawl axis fresh again, while a consumer evaluating a lapsed attestation still degrades the tier (crawl-freshness ≠ attestation-freshness — the freeze surface covered on the correct axis); (k) item staleness computed from `generated_at` → non-conforming (third-clock conflation).

## Appendix C — Canonical Vocabularies (ACIF-owned, normative)

**Authority statement.** The vocabularies in this appendix are **ACIF-owned normative text** — the canonical copies to which implementations, including Syllago and capmon, conform. They were repatriated on 2026-07-11 from the frozen Syllago snapshot (`cli/internal/converter/toolmap.go` and `hooks.go` at commit `cf047f52`) that Decisions #25 and #29 previously pinned by reference; from this point the reference direction is inverted (HANDOFF Step 4), joining Decisions #30 (rule activation modes), #31 (argument placeholders), and #33 (OS enum) as owned vocabularies. Divergence between a downstream implementation and this appendix is a bug in the implementation, not in ACIF. Provider-coverage facts implied by the mapping tables (which providers carry a name for a canonical entry) are observational snapshot data — capmon's crawled matrix is the living source for coverage; **this appendix is normative only for the canonical names, the mappings' render-back targets, and the translation disciplines.**

**Shared translation disciplines (normative for canonicalization and render-back):**

- **Canonicalize-then-hash:** provider-specific names are rewritten to canonical names at canonicalization; `body_hash` (Decision #19) is computed over the post-translation form (Decisions #25/#29, unchanged).
- **Unmapped passthrough:** rendering a canonical name to a provider with no mapping row emits the canonical name verbatim (no invention, no error — the render-back degradation lane's warning machinery applies where a walk defined one).
- **Reverse-translation determinism (hash-load-bearing):** where multiple canonical names map to one provider name, reverse translation MUST apply the pinned tiebreaker (per-table below). An unpinned tiebreak is the Decision #24 defect class — two registries canonicalizing the same provider file to different bytes.

### C.1 — Canonical tool vocabulary (17 names)

Canonical names are snake_case, provider-neutral. Mappings list `provider → native name`.

| Canonical | Provider mappings |
|---|---|
| `file_read` | claude-code `Read` · gemini-cli `read_file` · copilot-cli `view` · kiro `read` · opencode `read` · vs-code-copilot `Read` · zed `read_file` · roo-code `read_file` · cursor `read_file` · windsurf `view_line_range` · codex `read_file` · factory-droid `Read` · pi `read` |
| `file_write` | claude-code `Write` · gemini-cli `write_file` · copilot-cli `create` · kiro `fs_write` · opencode `write` · vs-code-copilot `Write` · zed `edit_file` · roo-code `write_to_file` · cursor `edit_file` · windsurf `write_to_file` · codex `apply_patch` · factory-droid `Create` · pi `write` |
| `file_edit` | claude-code `Edit` · gemini-cli `replace` · copilot-cli `edit` · kiro `fs_write` · opencode `edit` · vs-code-copilot `Edit` · zed `edit_file` · roo-code `replace_in_file` · cursor `edit_file` · windsurf `edit_file` · codex `apply_patch` · factory-droid `Edit` · pi `edit` |
| `shell` | claude-code `Bash` · gemini-cli `run_shell_command` · copilot-cli `bash` · kiro `shell` · opencode `bash` · vs-code-copilot `Bash` · zed `terminal` · roo-code `execute_command` · cursor `run_terminal_cmd` · windsurf `run_command` · codex `shell` · factory-droid `Execute` · pi `bash` |
| `find` | claude-code `Glob` · gemini-cli `glob` · copilot-cli `glob` · kiro `glob` · opencode `glob` · vs-code-copilot `Glob` · zed `find_path` · roo-code `list_files` · cursor `file_search` · windsurf `find_by_name` · codex `list_dir` · factory-droid `Glob` · pi `find` |
| `search` | claude-code `Grep` · gemini-cli `grep_search` · copilot-cli `grep` · kiro `grep` · opencode `grep` · vs-code-copilot `Grep` · zed `grep` · roo-code `search_files` · cursor `grep_search` · windsurf `grep_search` · codex `grep_files` · factory-droid `Grep` · pi `grep` |
| `web_search` | claude-code `WebSearch` · gemini-cli `google_web_search` · opencode `websearch` · vs-code-copilot `WebSearch` · zed `web_search` · cursor `web_search` · windsurf `search_web` · codex `web_search` · kiro `web_search` · factory-droid `WebSearch` |
| `agent` | claude-code `Agent` · copilot-cli `task` · opencode `task` · vs-code-copilot `Agent` · zed `spawn_agent` · codex `spawn_agent` · kiro `use_subagent` · factory-droid `Task` |
| `web_fetch` | claude-code `WebFetch` · gemini-cli `web_fetch` · copilot-cli `web_fetch` · kiro `web_fetch` · opencode `webfetch` · vs-code-copilot `WebFetch` · zed `fetch` · windsurf `read_url_content` · factory-droid `FetchUrl` |
| `list` | pi `ls` |
| `notebook_edit` | claude-code `NotebookEdit` · vs-code-copilot `NotebookEdit` |
| `multi_edit` | claude-code `MultiEdit` · vs-code-copilot `MultiEdit` |
| `list_dir` | claude-code `LS` · vs-code-copilot `LS` |
| `notebook_read` | claude-code `NotebookRead` · vs-code-copilot `NotebookRead` |
| `kill_shell` | claude-code `KillBash` · vs-code-copilot `KillBash` |
| `skill` | claude-code `Skill` · vs-code-copilot `Skill` |
| `ask_user` | claude-code `AskUserQuestion` · vs-code-copilot `AskUserQuestion` |

**Reverse-translation tiebreakers (normative):**
- **write/edit collapse:** zed and cursor use `edit_file`, codex uses `apply_patch`, and kiro uses `fs_write` for BOTH `file_write` and `file_edit` (the source snapshot's own comment listed only three of these four — the data is authoritative). Reverse translation prefers **`file_edit`** (the more specific operation). Round-trips through these providers are documented-lossy on the write/edit distinction.
- **Legacy alias:** claude-code's legacy `Task` (renamed `Agent` in claude-code v2.1.63) reverse-translates to canonical `agent`, case-insensitively.

**Matcher translation (normative):** hook matcher strings are translated component-wise on `|`-split alternations. Bare wildcards (`.*`, `*`) pass through; a `.*` suffix is stripped, the base translated, the suffix reattached; components containing `__`, `/`, or `:` (MCP-style and namespaced names) pass through untranslated.

**MCP tool-name formats (per-provider, for matcher passthrough and render-back):** claude-code/kiro/factory-droid `mcp__server__tool` · gemini-cli `mcp_server_tool` · opencode/cline/roo-code/cursor/windsurf `server__tool` · copilot-cli/codex `server/tool` · zed `mcp:server:tool`. Names not parseable under the source provider's pattern are not MCP tool names and pass through verbatim.

### C.2 — Canonical hook event vocabulary (39 names)

(Decision #29 estimated "approximately 30"; the exact count at repatriation is **39**.) Canonical names are snake_case. Long-tail single-provider coverage is observational, not a relaxation of the vocabulary.

| Canonical | Provider mappings |
|---|---|
| `before_tool_execute` | claude-code `PreToolUse` · gemini-cli `BeforeTool` · copilot-cli `preToolUse` · kiro `preToolUse` · cursor `PreToolUse` · opencode `tool.execute.before` · vs-code-copilot `PreToolUse` · factory-droid `PreToolUse` · pi `tool_call` |
| `after_tool_execute` | claude-code `PostToolUse` · gemini-cli `AfterTool` · copilot-cli `postToolUse` · kiro `postToolUse` · cursor `PostToolUse` · opencode `tool.execute.after` · vs-code-copilot `PostToolUse` · factory-droid `PostToolUse` · pi `tool_result` |
| `before_prompt` | claude-code `UserPromptSubmit` · gemini-cli `BeforeAgent` · copilot-cli `userPromptSubmitted` · kiro `userPromptSubmit` · cursor `UserPromptSubmit` · windsurf `pre_user_prompt` · vs-code-copilot `UserPromptSubmit` · factory-droid `UserPromptSubmit` · pi `input` |
| `agent_stop` | claude-code `Stop` · gemini-cli `AfterAgent` · kiro `stop` · copilot-cli `agentStop` · cursor `Stop` · windsurf `post_cascade_response` · opencode `session.idle` · vs-code-copilot `Stop` · factory-droid `Stop` · pi `agent_end` |
| `session_start` | claude-code `SessionStart` · gemini-cli `SessionStart` · copilot-cli `sessionStart` · kiro `agentSpawn` · cursor `SessionStart` · windsurf `session_start` · opencode `session.created` · vs-code-copilot `SessionStart` · factory-droid `SessionStart` · pi `session_start` |
| `session_end` | claude-code `SessionEnd` · gemini-cli `SessionEnd` · copilot-cli `sessionEnd` · cursor `SessionEnd` · windsurf `session_end` · factory-droid `SessionEnd` · pi `session_shutdown` |
| `before_compact` | claude-code `PreCompact` · gemini-cli `PreCompress` · cursor `PreCompact` · vs-code-copilot `PreCompact` · factory-droid `PreCompact` · pi `session_before_compact` |
| `notification` | claude-code `Notification` · gemini-cli `Notification` |
| `subagent_start` | claude-code `SubagentStart` · cursor `SubagentStart` · vs-code-copilot `SubagentStart` · factory-droid `SubagentStart` · pi `before_agent_start` |
| `subagent_stop` | claude-code `SubagentStop` · copilot-cli `subagentStop` · cursor `SubagentStop` · vs-code-copilot `SubagentStop` · factory-droid `SubagentStop` |
| `error_occurred` | claude-code `ErrorOccurred` · copilot-cli `errorOccurred` · opencode `session.error` |
| `tool_use_failure` | claude-code `PostToolUseFailure` · cursor `postToolUseFailure` · copilot-cli `errorOccurred` |
| `permission_request` | claude-code `PermissionRequest` · opencode `permission.asked` |
| `after_compact` | claude-code `PostCompact` |
| `instructions_loaded` | claude-code `InstructionsLoaded` |
| `config_change` | claude-code `ConfigChange` |
| `worktree_create` | claude-code `WorktreeCreate` · windsurf `post_setup_worktree` |
| `worktree_remove` | claude-code `WorktreeRemove` |
| `elicitation` | claude-code `Elicitation` |
| `elicitation_result` | claude-code `ElicitationResult` |
| `teammate_idle` | claude-code `TeammateIdle` |
| `task_completed` | claude-code `TaskCompleted` |
| `stop_failure` | claude-code `StopFailure` |
| `before_model` | gemini-cli `BeforeModel` · cursor `beforeAgentResponse` |
| `after_model` | gemini-cli `AfterModel` · cursor `afterAgentResponse` |
| `before_tool_selection` | gemini-cli `BeforeToolSelection` · cursor `beforeToolSelection` |
| `file_changed` | claude-code `FileChanged` · cursor `afterFileEdit` · kiro `File Save` · opencode `file.edited` |
| `file_created` | kiro `File Create` |
| `file_deleted` | kiro `File Delete` |
| `before_task` | kiro `Pre Task Execution` |
| `after_task` | kiro `Post Task Execution` |
| `transcript_export` | windsurf `post_cascade_response_with_transcript` |
| `turn_start` | pi `turn_start` |
| `turn_end` | pi `turn_end` |
| `model_select` | pi `model_select` |
| `user_bash` | pi `user_bash` |
| `context_update` | pi `context` |
| `message_start` | pi `message_start` |
| `message_end` | pi `message_end` |

**Reverse-translation tiebreaker (normative):** copilot-cli maps BOTH `error_occurred` and `tool_use_failure` to `errorOccurred`; reverse translation prefers **`error_occurred`**. For any other multi-match, the lexicographically smaller canonical name wins (determinism over source-map iteration order — the snapshot's Go implementation was order-dependent; ACIF's copy pins the tiebreak).

**Event-name validity:** an event name is recognized iff it is a canonical name in this table or any provider-native name appearing in it (guards key-injection via crafted event names, per the source's `IsValidHookEvent` intent).

### C.3 — Canonical handler-type enum

`HookEntry.Type ∈ {command, http, prompt, agent}` — closed enum, exact byte match (Decision #30 discipline). Per-type field sets (which optional fields are meaningful per type):

| Type | Fields |
|---|---|
| `command` | `scripts` (canonical entrypoint carrier — source formats' single `command` string maps to a script entry per Decision #33; amended at spec promotion, [ACIF-HOOK] §6/Appendix B), `timeout`, `status_message`, `async` |
| `http` | `url`, `headers`, `allowed_env_vars`, `timeout`, `status_message` |
| `prompt` | `prompt`, `model`, `timeout`, `status_message` |
| `agent` | `agent`, `timeout`, `status_message` |

**Legacy residual (normative, parallel to Decision #30's deterministic residual):** a source-format handler with `type` absent or empty is a `command` handler (the snapshot's backwards-compatibility default). The canonicalizer materializes the explicit `type: command` before `body_hash` is computed (the Decisions #24/#21/#30 materialize-then-hash pattern); validators MUST NOT re-apply the default.

## Spec-Promotion Ratifications (2026-07-11, HANDOFF Steps 5–6)

Decisions made at spec-promotion time, disclosed in each spec's provenance
appendix and ratified here so the design record and the specs agree. Spec
sections cited are the normative text; entries below are the record.

**Hash-coverage model ([ACIF-CORE] §7.8 — amends the reading of Decisions #11/#12/#19/#21/#30; spec-purist consult, ADOPT-WITH-FIXES):**
- Single-coverage: an extension block's hash home follows its carrier. Sidecar-only types (hook, mcp_config) → the whole canonical block is in the `body_hash` preimage (per Decision #33 as re-amended); frontmatter-bearing types (skill, rule, command, agent) → declared block values ride `metadata_hash` and never enter `body_hash`.
- `publisher_section` stays a **raw faithful observation** (Decision #11 unchanged — the consult rejected hashing canonical form as a silent amendment that would break Decision #15's conflict comparison). Materialized defaults are canonical-form-only: never written into `publisher_section`, covered by no hash (deterministic functions of declared absence).
- `publisher_section` presence follows **declaration, not content type**; for sidecar-only types it is envelope-only (resolves the pack_id-for-hooks tension; [ACIF-HOOK] §9.4 note corrected). Pack records: declared packs carry `metadata_hash`, inferred packs carry neither section-hash, no pack has `body_hash` ([ACIF-PUBLISHER] §8.2).
- Decision #17 tuple endpoint gains `metadata_hash_if_present` (nullable) — [ACIF-REGISTRY] §7.
- `metadata_hash` preimage pinned byte-precise: RFC 8785 JCS of `publisher_section` + one trailing LF ([ACIF-PUBLISHER] §6; TV-9 locks it).

**Per-type ratifications:**
- Skill: `hook_ref` OPTIONAL under `type: hook` (Decision #21 normative text over the old schema comment); error identifiers `acif.skill.activation_type_missing/_invalid`, `hook_ref_forbidden`, `hook_ref_id_missing`; TV-SKILL (h) restated (materialization moves neither hash) + new (k) hash-boundary, (l) rejects, (m) hook-without-ref accept.
- Rule: `acif.rule.activation_degraded` (MUST-emit render diagnostic — gate loss made visible); `globs: []` rejects as `glob_mode_without_globs`; glob elements non-empty opaque strings, no dialect validation; `_invalid`/`_unmappable` locus discriminator (value-in-field vs structural mechanism); TV-RULE (l)/(m) added.
- Command: `acif.command.placeholder_untranslated` (dual-actor: render MUST-emit / install SHOULD-warn); shadowing advisory, when emitted, names provider + colliding name; TV-COMMAND (h′)/(m) added.
- Agent: extension block drawn (see the Agent Extension Block section); `tools` order preserved, entries non-empty, null arrays = absent; `permission_mode`/`background` opaque passthrough; renderers never substitute resolved UUIDs for declared names; TV-AGENT family restated in hash-boundary terms.
- MCP: Decision #23 application restated 5 DERIVABLE / 3 OOS-L1 (result unchanged); `env_var_expansion` D_K domain pinned to the closed field set `{command, args[i], env.<key>, url, headers.<key>}`; sidecar-only preimage instantiated ([ACIF-MCP] §8 — empty-manifest constant, tool-filter arrays sorted+deduped, `args` order preserved); identifiers `acif.mcp.servers_missing`, `transport_type_invalid`, `server_name_unconventional`.
- Publisher/Registry: `acif.publisher.frontmatter_conflict` (per-run opt-in overwrite), `acif.publisher.pack_source_conflict`; pack-record `registry_section` variant with computed `items`; `install_scope_capabilities` entries non-conformant without a `source` tag; advisory entries non-conformant without a `method` stamp.
- Render: fidelity-class taxonomy (lossless / documented-lossy / degraded / refused; one disclosure home per path); render-context pinning; cross-implementation member order must come from a shared source; enumerable round-trip loss bound; TV-RENDER family.
- Core: empty `requires` map normalizes to absence in canonical form (empty/absent were distinct sidecar-only preimage bytes); structurally-constant D_K sanctioned where the owning L1 says so.

**Process record:** all ten documents passed spec-purist review (hooks/core gated earlier as exemplars; five L1s and L2/L3/L4 in two parallel batch reviews, all SHIP-WITH-FIXES, all findings applied). The conformance suite (150 vectors, 11 families) is published under `conformance/`; vectors are normatively authoritative over prose.
