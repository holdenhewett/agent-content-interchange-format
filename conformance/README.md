# ACIF Conformance Suite

**Status:** Draft, tracks the ACIF 0.1.x specification set.

This directory publishes the ACIF conformance test vectors. Per every ACIF
specification's conformance clause: **the vectors are normatively
authoritative over prose** — an implementation that contradicts a published
vector is non-conformant regardless of any prose reading. The scripts under
`reference/` are informative; when a script and a vector disagree, the vector
is correct and the script has a bug.

## Layout

```
conformance/
  vectors/           # normative — one YAML catalog per family
    core.yaml        # TV-1..TV-10 + TV-L2-* (record & pack layer)
    hook.yaml        # TV-HOOK-*   ([ACIF-HOOK] Appendix C)
    platform.yaml    # TV-PLATFORM-* ([ACIF-HOOK] Appendix C; type-general)
    skill.yaml       # TV-SKILL-*  ([ACIF-SKILL] Appendix B)

  reference/         # informative — reference implementation + generator
    acif_hash.py     # body_hash / metadata_hash / sidecar-only preimage reference
    generate_vectors.py  # fills computed hash values into the catalogs
```

## Vector format

Each catalog is a YAML list. Every vector carries:

| Field | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `id` | Stable vector ID (`TV-<FAMILY>-<letter>`, matching the owning spec appendix) |
| `spec` | Owning spec section(s) the vector enforces |
| `harness` | `static` \| `mock-transport` \| `mock-crawl` — which harness family runs it |
| `description` | What the vector proves |
| `input` | The fixture: inline file trees (`files: {path: content}`), source blocks, URIs, timestamps, or render contexts |
| `expect` | The required outcome: canonical form assertions, `error` (a named `acif.*` identifier), `evaluation` results, hash equalities/inequalities, or byte-exact hash values |

Hash-bearing `expect` values are computed by `reference/generate_vectors.py`
and committed into the catalogs; a value of `"<computed>"` marks a slot the
generator has not yet filled and is a defect in the suite, not a free pass.

Inline file-tree fixtures use literal block scalars; content is written with
`\n` line endings unless the vector is explicitly about line-ending
normalization, in which case escaped byte sequences are spelled out in the
description and encoded with YAML double-quoted escapes.

## Harness families

Two harness families exist, and conformance MUST NOT be claimed on the static
family alone where a spec requires both ([ACIF-REGISTRY] §5):

- **static** — pure-function vectors: bytes in, canonical form / hash /
  identifier out. No I/O beyond the fixture.
- **mock-transport** — vectors that require an HTTP double (redirect chains,
  downgrade detection, chain limits) for the `source_uri` pipeline.
- **mock-crawl** — vectors that require two crawl passes over changing
  registry state (re-crawl stability, freshness re-stamping).

## ID stability

Vector IDs are stable once published. The lettered IDs correspond one-to-one
with the family definitions in the owning spec appendices; a future vector
added to a family takes the next unused letter (or a `-2` suffix once letters
exhaust) and never renumbers existing vectors.
