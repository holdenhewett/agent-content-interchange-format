# Skill Interchange Format (SIF) — Draft Spec

**Version:** 0.1.0-draft
**Status:** Draft — not normative
**Derived from:** syllago canonical-keys.yaml + provider-formats/*.yaml (snapshot 2026-05-11)

---

## 1. Overview

A **skill** is a self-contained unit of agent behavior authored as a Markdown document. When installed, it expands what an AI coding tool can do without requiring changes to the host tool itself. Skills describe tasks (e.g., "deploy to staging", "summarize a PR") that an agent can invoke — either automatically when the conversation topic matches, or explicitly when the user types the skill's name.

This spec defines a **provider-neutral canonical format** for skills. It serves the same purpose for skills that the Hook Interchange Format (HIF) serves for hooks: a shared vocabulary that lets a skill authored once be understood by any conforming tool.

### 1.1 What this spec defines

- A canonical data model for skills in YAML frontmatter
- The set of canonical capability keys and what each means
- How provider-native fields map to canonical keys across 15 providers
- Carrier rules (sidecar is the primary canonical carrier; YAML frontmatter in the skill file is an opt-in supplementary layer)
- A conversion enum for provider extensions that have no canonical equivalent
- Open questions that must be resolved before this spec reaches normative status

### 1.2 What this spec does not define

- Provider-specific extension fields beyond what maps to canonical keys
- Skill discovery, installation, or registry distribution
- Cryptographic signing or provenance (see MOAT)
- Skill execution semantics or runtime behavior
- Render-back (converting from canonical form to provider-native layout) — that is an L4 concern

### 1.3 Relationship to HIF

HIF is the canonical interchange format for hooks. SIF follows the same architecture:
- Both define a per-content-type canonical vocabulary
- Both use a conversion enum (`translated | embedded | dropped | preserved | not-portable`) for provider extensions
- Both leave provider-exclusive fields in a `provider_data` escape hatch

The key structural difference is the publisher input surface: hooks have no inline path because the host tool owns the config file schema (`settings.json`, `mcp.json`), so the sidecar is the only input mechanism. Skills are Markdown files publishers author directly, so YAML frontmatter in `SKILL.md` is also available as an opt-in publisher input. Both content types share the same canonical artifact at the registry layer — a sidecar.

---

## 2. Canonical Data Model

A canonical skill is represented as YAML frontmatter embedded in a Markdown file (`SKILL.md`). The Markdown body is the skill's instructional content — the text the agent reads when the skill is invoked.

### 2.1 File layout

```
<skill-name>/
  SKILL.md          # Required. YAML frontmatter + Markdown body.
  [other files]     # Optional. Supporting scripts, templates, configs.
```

The directory name is the skill's **discovery handle** — what registries scan for and what `@`-style file references use. The skill's stable **identity** is its item UUIDv4 (SHAPE.md common envelope line 14, Decision #2), which is invariant across directory renames. When `display_name` is absent from frontmatter, implementations SHOULD use the directory name as the display name.

### 2.2 Frontmatter structure

```yaml
---
name: deploy-to-staging
description: Deploy the current branch to the staging environment.
version: 1.0.0
license: MIT
auto_invocable: true
disable-model-invocation: false
user-invocable: true
compatibility:
  min_version: "1.0"
metadata:
  team: platform
---
```

All fields are OPTIONAL unless noted. The Markdown body follows the closing `---`.

### 2.3 Canonical data model table

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `name` | string | Human-readable display name. If absent, directory name is used. |
| `description` | string | What the skill does. Shown in listings; drives auto-invocation matching. |
| `version` | string | Optional. When declared, MUST be valid SemVer 2.0.0 (SHAPE.md Decision #20). Literal-or-absent per Decision #16; the registry MUST NOT synthesize, inherit, or derive a value when the publisher omits it. `body_hash` is the canonical per-item change signal (Decision #17); `version` is advisory. |
| `license` | string | SPDX license identifier (e.g., `MIT`, `Apache-2.0`). |
| `auto_invocable` | bool | Whether the model can auto-invoke this skill without explicit user syntax. Default: `true` when description is present. |
| `disable-model-invocation` | bool | When `true`, prevents model from auto-invoking. Supersedes `auto_invocable`. Default: `false`. |
| `user-invocable` | bool | When `false`, hides the skill from user-facing menus (e.g., `/` command menu). The model may still invoke it. Default: `true`. |
| `compatibility` | object | Provider compatibility constraints. Schema is provider-defined; canonical shape is unspecified in this version. |
| `metadata` | object | Arbitrary key-value pairs for tooling or automation metadata. |

**Note on `auto_invocable` vs `disable-model-invocation`:** These are two sides of the same concept expressed differently by providers. `auto_invocable` is additive (capability declaration); `disable-model-invocation` is subtractive (opt-out). Both map to the same semantic. The canonical form retains both because `disable-model-invocation` is the field name used by providers that implement per-skill opt-out (Claude Code, Cursor, Codex, crush, factory-droid, pi).

---

## 3. Canonical Capability Keys

These are the keys defined in syllago's `CanonicalSkillsKeys` and `canonical-keys.yaml`. They describe capabilities in the skill content type — not field values, but behavioral/structural facts about how a provider implements skills. They are used in syllago's capability monitoring system and form the vocabulary that this spec's canonical data model is derived from.

| Canonical Key | Type | Description | Notes |
|---------------|------|-------------|-------|
| `display_name` | string | Human-readable name shown in listings; falls back to directory name if absent | Maps to `name` frontmatter field in all providers |
| `description` | string | What the skill does; drives auto-invocation decisions and is shown in help text | Required in most providers; max 1024 chars in codex/pi |
| `license` | string | SPDX license identifier | Optional; supported by open-standard providers |
| `compatibility` | object | Provider version/platform compatibility constraints | Optional; schema undefined at canonical level |
| `metadata_map` | object | Arbitrary key-value metadata for tooling | Optional; supported by open-standard providers |
| `auto_invocable` | bool | Model can auto-invoke without explicit user syntax | Equivalent to presence of description + absence of disable flag |
| `disable_model_invocation` | bool | Opt-out from model auto-invocation | Frontmatter key `disable-model-invocation` (hyphenated) in provider files |
| `user_invocable` | bool | Skill appears in user-facing menus | Frontmatter key `user-invocable` (hyphenated); default true |
| `version` | string | Optional semantic version. When declared, MUST be valid SemVer 2.0.0 (SHAPE.md Decision #20). | Literal-or-absent per Decision #16; `body_hash` (Decision #17) is the canonical change signal. |
| `project_scope` | bool | Can be installed at project scope (committed to repo) | Structural: presence of `.xxx/skills/` directory convention |
| `global_scope` | bool | Can be installed at user/personal scope (home directory) | Structural: presence of `~/.xxx/skills/` path |
| `shared_scope` | bool | Can be installed at enterprise/shared scope | Structural: organization-level distribution path |
| `canonical_filename` | string | Required or conventional filename (always `SKILL.md`, except kiro which uses `POWER.md`) | |
| `custom_filename` | bool | Whether non-standard filenames are accepted | Only factory-droid (`skill.mdx`) and pi (single-file `.md`) support this |
| `skill_bundled_resources` | bool | Skill directory may contain arbitrary co-located files beyond the primary skill file | Supporting scripts, templates, configs loaded on demand |

**Frontmatter key naming note:** The canonical key names in this spec use underscores (`disable_model_invocation`). The provider-side frontmatter keys use hyphens (`disable-model-invocation`) because YAML frontmatter keys are case-sensitive and the hyphenated form is what providers actually implement. When converting, translators must map between these forms.

### 4.3 Provider extension fields with no canonical equivalent

These are fields present in one or more providers that currently have no canonical key. They are candidates for future canonicalization or remain as `provider_data` entries.

| Provider | Extension Field | Conversion | Description |

| claude-code | `argument-hint` | `embedded` | Autocomplete hint for expected argument format (presentational) |
| claude-code | `allowed-tools` | `embedded` | Pre-approves tool calls while skill is active |
| claude-code | `model` | `embedded` | Per-skill model override |
| claude-code | `effort` | `embedded` | Per-skill effort level override |
| claude-code | `context` / `agent` | `embedded` | Subagent execution context for skill invocation |
| claude-code | `hooks` | `embedded` | Lifecycle hooks scoped to this skill's active period |

| claude-code | `arguments` | `preserved` | Named positional arguments for `$name` substitution |
| claude-code | `when_to_use` | `embedded` | Additional context for when Claude should invoke the skill |
| codex | `metadata.short-description` | `embedded` | Condensed description for compact UI |
| codex | `interface.icon_small` / `icon_large` | `dropped` | Skill card icons (via openai.yaml) |
| codex | `interface.brand_color` | `dropped` | Brand color for skill card |
| codex | `interface.default_prompt` | `embedded` | Default prompt for UI invocation |
| codex | `dependencies.tools` | `embedded` | Required MCP servers or external tools |
| codex | `policy.products` | `dropped` | Product gating (OpenAI-specific) |
| cursor | `globs` | `embedded` | Glob patterns scoping skill to specific files; no canonical equivalent |
| factory-droid | `argument-hint` | `translated` | Autocomplete hint (same concept as claude-code) |
| factory-droid | `$ARGUMENTS` substitution | `translated` | Argument substitution in skill body |
| kiro | `displayName` | `embedded` | Human-readable label separate from slug `name` |
| kiro | `keywords` | `embedded` | Keyword array for model auto-activation (alternative to description matching) |
| kiro | `# Onboarding` section | `not-portable` | First-activation onboarding instructions block |
| kiro | `mcp.json` in skill dir | `not-portable` | Bundled MCP server config inside skill directory |
| amp | `toolbox/` executables | `not-portable` | Executables in `toolbox/` auto-registered as tools |
| amp | `mcp.json` in skill dir | `not-portable` | Bundled MCP server (same concept as kiro) |

## 5. Carrier Rules

A skill's canonical metadata has two carriers: a sidecar file that is always generated at the registry layer, and YAML frontmatter inside `SKILL.md` that is available as an opt-in publisher input.

### 5.1 Primary carrier: sidecar (always generated)

Every skill in a conforming registry has a canonical sidecar record containing the fields defined in §2. The sidecar is the authoritative source for downstream consumers. Two production paths are conformant:

- **Registry-generated.** The registry crawls the publisher source, parses any frontmatter present, and emits a sidecar. This is the primary path for the existing installed base, which has no L2 metadata in source files.
- **Publisher-side CI.** Publishers may opt into a CI workflow that generates the sidecar at publish time and stores it alongside the content. The sidecar is still the canonical artifact; the CI path simply moves generation upstream.

Publishers are never required to hand-author sidecars.

### 5.2 Supplementary carrier: YAML frontmatter (opt-in)

Publishers may also maintain canonical fields in the YAML frontmatter block at the top of `SKILL.md`:

```
---
<canonical fields here>
---
<skill body — Markdown instructional content>
```

This is the same convention used by 14 of the 15 providers in this survey (kiro uses `POWER.md` instead of `SKILL.md` but otherwise follows the same frontmatter pattern). Frontmatter is intentionally redundant with the sidecar; the redundancy serves portability so a copied `SKILL.md` carries its own metadata.

**Data flows sidecar → frontmatter, never the reverse.** A publisher who opts into the frontmatter path may populate it manually or via a second optional CI workflow that projects sidecar values into the source file. The frontmatter CI MUST block the build on any conflict between an existing ACIF field in frontmatter and the canonical sidecar value (default behavior); auto-overwrite is available via an explicit input (`conflict-resolution: overwrite`). Missing ACIF fields are added silently. Non-ACIF fields (harness keys, publisher custom metadata) always pass through untouched.

The `openai.yaml` companion file used by codex is a provider-specific extension (`not-portable`) — it carries codex-specific interface and policy metadata that has no canonical equivalent in this spec and is not the ACIF sidecar.

### 5.3 Directory structure is normative

The skill's directory name is its **discovery handle and install path**: implementations MUST NOT rename the directory during installation, because cross-content `@`-style file references and the heuristic discovery tier (§5.6) both resolve through it. The skill's stable **identity** is the item UUIDv4 in the sidecar (SHAPE.md common envelope line 14, Decision #2), which survives directory renames and is the load-bearing key for any cross-content-type reference (e.g., hook → skill activation per Decision #21). `display_name` frontmatter is a human-readable override of neither the directory handle nor the UUID identity.

### 5.4 Supporting files are non-normative

The supporting files pattern (arbitrary co-located files beyond `SKILL.md`) is a widely-adopted convention but is not canonically specified at the file level. The `skill_bundled_resources` canonical key records whether a provider supports the pattern. How publishers structure those files (subdirectory names like `scripts/`, `templates/`, etc.) is not standardized.

### 5.5 Canonical provider slug list

When a skill is installed for a specific provider, the target provider is indicated by directory path convention rather than a field in the frontmatter. The following canonical provider slugs are defined for use in tool-side configuration and render-back:

| Slug | Provider | Notes |
|------|----------|-------|
| `amp` | Amp (Sourcegraph) | |
| `claude-code` | Claude Code (Anthropic) | |
| `cline` | Cline | |
| `codex` | Codex (OpenAI) | |
| `copilot-cli` | GitHub Copilot CLI | |
| `crush` | Crush (Charmbracelet) | |
| `cursor` | Cursor | |
| `factory-droid` | Factory Droid | |
| `gemini-cli` | Gemini CLI (Google) | |
| `kiro` | Kiro (Amazon) | Uses `POWER.md`; canonical_filename differs |
| `opencode` | OpenCode (sst) | Uses cross-provider convention only |
| `pi` | Pi (badlogic) | |
| `roo-code` | Roo Code | |
| `windsurf` | Windsurf (Codeium) | |

### 5.6 Skill discovery (three-tier)

Per SHAPE.md Decision #22, registries discover skill items via three tiers, applied in order. The first tier that produces a result wins; subsequent tiers are not consulted for the same publisher.

1. **Publisher-declared.** If the pack manifest declares `skill_paths: ["./skills/", "./advanced/"]`, the registry uses those paths. This is the explicit "manual pointer" mechanism for publishers with non-standard layouts.
2. **Heuristic + filename fallback.** The registry scans known directories (`.agents/skills/`, `.<provider>/skills/`, `~/.agents/skills/`, etc. — see §4.2) and recognizes:
   - `SKILL.md` (canonical filename) inside a skill-named directory — recognized unconditionally.
   - Any `*.md` file with `kind: skill` frontmatter — heuristic recognition for non-canonical filenames.
   - A bare `.md` file at a known discovery path with no frontmatter — filename (sans extension) is used as the skill `name`.
3. **Non-conformant.** Arbitrary layouts with no pack manifest, no canonical filename, and no `kind: skill` frontmatter are out of scope. The publisher must adopt one of the conformant patterns.

Notes:
- Tier 2 is essential for adoption — round 1 of the repo survey found ~⅓ of high-star repos ship no manifest at all. The heuristic + filename fallback covers this corpus without forcing those publishers to author a manifest.
- The `.agents/skills/` cross-provider convention (see Appendix B) is the recommended discovery path when no pack manifest is present.
- Discovery only locates skills; it does not assign identity. Each discovered skill receives an item UUIDv4 (per SHAPE.md common envelope line 14) when first registered. Renaming a skill directory does not change its identity.

### 5.7 Activation cross-references (hook → skill)

Per SHAPE.md Decision #21, a skill MAY declare its activation mechanism, and a hook MAY declare that it activates a specific skill. This is the first cross-content-type relationship in ACIF; it is defined here so render-back and registry tooling can resolve the link.

**Skill side** (in the skill extension block defined in SHAPE.md):

```yaml
skill:
  activation:                   # optional — defaults to type: auto when absent
    type: manual | auto | hook  # required when activation block present
    hook_ref:                   # required when type: hook
      id: "f47ac10b-..."        # UUIDv4 of the activating hook (load-bearing)
      name: "skill-activator"   # advisory only; renames don't break the reference
```

**Hook side** (in the hook extension block):

```yaml
hook:
  activation_target:
    skill:
      id: "550e8400-..."        # UUIDv4 of the target skill (load-bearing)
      name: "tdd-workflow"      # advisory only
```

**Canonical truth lives on the hook** (`activation_target`). The skill's `activation` block is a discovery convenience — a registry MAY compute the reverse mapping from hook records and omit `hook_ref` on the skill side without loss of information.

**Cross-references use item UUIDv4, not `(pack_id, name)`.** UUIDv4 (SHAPE.md common envelope line 14) is globally unique by construction. The `name` field on either side is human-readable advisory only and MUST NOT be relied on for resolution. A skill rename, a directory rename, or a pack reorganization does not break the activation link.

The three activation types:
- **`manual`** — user explicitly invokes the skill (e.g., `/skillname`).
- **`auto`** — model decides whether to invoke based on `description` matching. This is the default when the `activation` block is absent.
- **`hook`** — a hook makes the activation decision at runtime. The hook's `activation_target.skill.id` identifies the target; the skill's optional `hook_ref` is a discovery convenience pointing back.

## 6. Conversion Pipeline (Sketch)

The skill conversion pipeline mirrors HIF §7 but is simpler — skills have no exit code contracts, matcher systems, or handler type variations. The essential stages:

1. **Decode** — Read `SKILL.md` frontmatter, map provider-native field names to canonical keys.
2. **Validate** — Check that required fields are present for the target provider.
3. **Encode** — Write `SKILL.md` with the target provider's expected frontmatter key names and directory path conventions.
4. **Verify** — Re-read the output and confirm round-trip fidelity.

Notable decode complexities:
- `disable-model-invocation` (hyphenated in YAML) must map to `disable_model_invocation` (underscored) in canonical form.
- Codex's `disable_model_invocation` equivalent lives in `agents/openai.yaml` (companion file), not in `SKILL.md` frontmatter.
- Kiro's auto-invocation trigger is `keywords` (array), not `description` matching — these are semantically different mechanisms mapped to the same canonical key (`auto_invocable`).
- Factory-droid's `disable-model-invocation` default is `false` (model may invoke); claude-code's is also `false`. Both match canonical default.

---

## 7. Open Questions

These are unresolved questions that must be answered before this spec can reach normative status. They are surfaced here as a research agenda.

**OQ-1: Cursor `globs` field**
Cursor supports a `globs` frontmatter array that restricts skill auto-activation to files matching the glob patterns. No other provider has an equivalent canonical key for this. Options: (a) add `activation_globs` as a new canonical key, (b) put it in `provider_data` as `not-portable`. The `paths` field in claude-code does the same thing. This may already warrant graduation to a canonical key given two providers support it.

**OQ-2: `auto_invocable` vs `disable_model_invocation` canonicalization**
These two keys express the same concept from opposite directions. The canonical data model currently carries both. A cleaner model would unify them into a single canonical key (e.g., `model_invocation: enabled | disabled`). The tradeoff: the hyphenated `disable-model-invocation` is already the de facto standard field name in the Agent Skills spec, and changing it would break existing skill files. Decision needed before normative publication.

**OQ-3: Kiro's `POWER.md` and `keywords` mechanism**
Kiro calls skills "powers" and uses `POWER.md` as the canonical filename. Its auto-invocation is keyword-based (explicit `keywords` array) rather than description-matching. Questions:
- Should this spec treat kiro as a conforming provider with a non-standard filename, or as a separate content type that happens to overlap?
- The `keywords` mechanism is semantically different from description-based matching but maps to the same `auto_invocable` key. Is that correct, or does it need its own key?

**OQ-4: `displayName` vs `name` in kiro**
Kiro uses `name` as a slug identifier and `displayName` as a separate human-readable label. Most providers collapse both into `name`. Should `display_name` (the canonical key) map to kiro's `displayName` or `name`? If kiro's `name` is a slug-style identifier and `displayName` is the human-readable label, then the canonical `display_name` maps to `displayName` and the slug identity maps to directory name — but that creates an inconsistency with all other providers where `name` is both the slug and display name.

**OQ-5: `version` key — frontmatter or out-of-band? (RESOLVED)**
Resolved by SHAPE.md Decisions #16 and #20. `version` is an L2 publisher metadata field that lives in `publisher_section`. It is literal-or-absent (Decision #16; no inheritance, no derivation, no registry synthesis) and, when declared, MUST be valid SemVer 2.0.0 (Decision #20). The frontmatter path is permitted as a supplementary carrier under SHAPE.md Decision #10 — when present, the value is carried verbatim into `publisher_section.version`. When absent, `body_hash` (Decision #17) serves as the canonical per-item change signal; consumers MUST NOT fall back to a synthesized version.

**OQ-6: `license` and `compatibility` field schemas**
Both are declared as `type: object` in canonical-keys.yaml but no provider defines a normative schema for either. The `compatibility` field in pi has a max 500 char constraint (suggesting it's a string, not an object), while opencode and cursor accept arbitrary object maps. The canonical type needs to be settled.

**OQ-7: `shared_scope` semantics are inconsistent**
Providers map `shared_scope` to very different things:
- codex: `/etc/codex/skills/` — machine-level, all local users
- claude-code: managed settings — organization-level, cloud delivery
- windsurf: OS-specific enterprise system path — managed IT deployment
- roo-code: `.agents/skills/` (cross-provider convention) — not actually a "shared" scope in the enterprise sense

The `shared_scope` key may need to be split into `machine_scope` (all users on one machine) and `enterprise_scope` (organization-wide) to avoid conflating these.

**OQ-8: Argument substitution in skills**
Claude-code, factory-droid, and pi support argument substitution in skill bodies (`$ARGUMENTS`, `$ARGUMENTS[N]`). This is not currently a canonical key. It may belong in the commands interchange format rather than here, since skills with arguments blur the skills/commands boundary. Claude-code explicitly documents `.claude/commands/` as the legacy equivalent of `.claude/skills/`.

**OQ-9: Scope path conventions — canonical or informative?**
The install paths (e.g., `.claude/skills/`, `.agents/skills/`, `~/.gemini/skills/`) are provider-specific. This spec documents them in the provider mappings table (§4.2), but should it normatively specify the canonical cross-provider path `.agents/skills/` as the preferred install location? 12 of 14 supported providers recognize `.agents/skills/` as a project-scope discovery path. Making it normative in this spec would give registries and install tools a single portable path to target.

**OQ-10: `openai.yaml` companion file graduation**
Codex's `openai.yaml` companion file carries fields (dependencies, interface icons, product gating) with no canonical equivalent. The `tool_dependencies` field may have cross-provider relevance as skill-MCP-bundling becomes more common (amp and kiro both bundle MCP servers in skill directories). Should dependency declarations graduate to a canonical key, or remain in `provider_data`?

## Appendix A: Agent Skills Open Standard

Many providers reference the "Agent Skills open standard" (agentskills.io). The standard's core field set is:

```yaml
name: string        # required, ≤64 chars
description: string # required, ≤1024 chars
license: string     # optional, SPDX
compatibility: any  # optional
metadata: object    # optional
disable-model-invocation: bool  # optional
```

Providers that explicitly implement this standard: amp, claude-code, cline, codex, copilot-cli, crush, cursor, factory-droid, gemini-cli, opencode, pi, roo-code (partial), windsurf.

The canonical keys in this spec are a superset of the open standard's core fields. Fields defined in this spec but not in the open standard (`user_invocable`, `version`, `project_scope`, `global_scope`, `shared_scope`, `canonical_filename`, `custom_filename`, `skill_bundled_resources`) are syllago capability-tracking keys describing structural/behavioral facts about providers, not additional frontmatter fields for publishers to set.

## Appendix B: Cross-Provider Discovery Path

The path `.agents/skills/<name>/SKILL.md` (project) and `~/.agents/skills/<name>/SKILL.md` (user) is recognized by the following providers as an alias for their native discovery path:

amp, codex, copilot-cli, crush, cursor, factory-droid, gemini-cli, pi, roo-code, windsurf

This makes `.agents/skills/` the de facto portable install location. See Open Question OQ-9 for discussion of whether this should be normative in this spec.
