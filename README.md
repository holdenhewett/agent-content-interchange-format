# agent-content-interchange-format

A set of independent, layered specifications for describing, distributing, and rendering AI agent content — skills, hooks, rules, commands, sub-agents, and MCP configs — across the AI coding tool ecosystem.

## Why this exists

Today, AI agent content is published in provider-native formats. A "hook" for Claude Code, a "hook" for Cursor, and a "hook" for Codex are three different files even when they invoke the same underlying behavior. There is no provider-neutral way to:

1. **Describe** what an agent content item *is* (its capabilities, dependencies, runtime needs)
2. **Distribute** it through a registry that doesn't care which provider it targets
3. **Render** it back into one or more provider-native shells

This project pulls those three concerns apart into independent specs that can be adopted incrementally.

## Not a vendor plugin or marketplace system

ACIF is **not** a plugin format, a marketplace schema, or a distribution mechanism for any single provider. It is a direct, open-source, provider-agnostic alternative to those systems.

Vendor plugin and marketplace systems — Anthropic's `.claude-plugin/plugin.json` and `marketplace.json`, similar formats from other tooling vendors, and the various "install our extension to publish here" registries — are exactly the problem ACIF exists to solve. They tie content authors to one vendor's distribution path. Adopting a vendor's plugin format means accepting that vendor's roadmap, that vendor's discovery surface, that vendor's installation flow, and that vendor's terms. If your skill or rule or agent only ships through one vendor's marketplace, your content lives at that vendor's pleasure.

ACIF treats those systems as the status quo it competes with, not as authoritative inputs to its design:

- ACIF's carrier model, hashing, and discovery rules are designed around the **content itself** — the SKILL.md directory, the `.mdc` rule file, the AGENTS.md marker, the `.mcp.json` runtime wiring — not around any vendor's plugin manifest.
- Vendor plugin and marketplace manifests are not in ACIF's content-source precedence chain. A repo that ships only a `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json` is treated as a repo with no ACIF pack identity (registry-inferred, per Decision #18) — same treatment as a repo with no manifest at all.
- ACIF's "publish once, render to N tools" model deliberately routes around vendor distribution lock-in. Publishers describe content in a neutral format; registries serve it without vendor approval; render-back emits provider-native files for whichever tools the consumer actually uses.

The six content types ACIF cares about — **hook, skill, rule, command, agent, mcp_config** — are the units that should be portable. Vendor plugin and marketplace systems are distribution wrappers around those units. ACIF is the alternative wrapper: open, neutral, and not owned by any one vendor.

```

Each layer is independently adoptable. A publisher can adopt L2 without L1. A registry can adopt L3 without forcing publishers to adopt L2 (it auto-generates the metadata). Render-back (L4) is a tooling concern that consumes L1.

## Layer details

### L1 — Canonical Interchange Formats

One spec per content type. Each is a standalone document that defines:

- The canonical capability vocabulary for that content type
- How provider-native fields map to canonical keys
- A conversion enum: `translated | embedded | dropped | preserved | not-portable`
- Reference test vectors and (ideally) reference implementations

**Status:**

| Content type | Canonical format | Spec status |
|---|---|---|
| Hooks | HIF in syllago (`docs/provider-formats/*.yaml`, canonical-keys.yaml) | Exemplar — not yet pulled into `specs/hooks-interchange/` |
| Skills | Implemented in syllago | Draft at `specs/skill-interchange/spec.md` (snapshot 2026-05-11) |
| MCP configs | Implemented in syllago | Not yet externalized |
| Commands | Implemented in syllago | Not yet externalized |
| Sub-agents | Implemented in syllago | Not yet externalized |
| Rules | Implemented in syllago | Not yet externalized |

The canonical formats already exist as code in syllago (`cli/internal/capmon/recognize_*.go` + `docs/spec/canonical-keys.yaml` + `docs/provider-formats/*.yaml`). What this project does is *externalize* them into independent, versioned specs that other tools can implement without depending on syllago.

### L2 — Publisher Metadata Spec

Defines what a publisher declares about each content item: version label, dependencies, runtime requirements, license, content type, capabilities.

**Carrier rules:**

- **Sidecar (always generated)** — universal primary carrier for every content type. Generated by the registry or by an optional publisher-side CI workflow. Hand-authored sidecars are never required.
- **Frontmatter (opt-in)** — for skills, rules, agents, and commands, publishers may also maintain canonical fields in YAML frontmatter inside the content file. Either hand-authored or auto-populated by a second optional CI workflow. Hooks and MCP configs have no frontmatter path because the harness owns `settings.json`/`mcp.json`.

The sidecar is canonical at the registry layer. Frontmatter is a publisher convenience that mirrors the sidecar for portability — a copied content file carries its own metadata. Data flows sidecar → frontmatter, never the reverse. The frontmatter CI is conservative by default: it blocks the build on any conflict with the canonical sidecar, requiring explicit opt-in to auto-overwrite.

The publisher does as little as possible. Most existing content has no L2 metadata at all; the registry auto-generates everything from the body. Frontmatter is for publishers who want to declare canonical fields explicitly.

### L3 — Registry Consumption Spec

Defines how a registry:

1. Indexes content from publisher repos
2. Computes `content_hash` over canonical bytes (the identity primitive)
3. Auto-generates publisher metadata when absent (Debian overlay pattern)
4. Serves content to install tools (conforming clients per MOAT)

The registry never modifies the publisher's files. Auto-generated metadata is overlay metadata held by the registry, not pushed back upstream.

### L4 — Render-back

Given a canonical item (L1), deterministically emit one or more provider-native files. A single canonical hook produces both `hooks.json` (Claude format) and `hooks-cursor.json` (Cursor format) from the same source.

Render-back is what makes the canonical formats useful: publishers author once, registries serve once, tools install for any provider.

## Relationship to other projects

- **MOAT** — Signs and attests content bytes. Composes underneath this project: registries that implement L3 can use MOAT to attest their indexes; conforming clients verify those attestations at install. MOAT does not care about content type or capability — it operates on bytes.
- **syllago** — Personal package manager and conversion engine that already implements all six canonical formats internally. This project externalizes those formats into independent specs so other tools can adopt them without depending on syllago.

## Working method

This is an exercise, not a deliverable yet. We use `obra/superpowers` (cloned to `~/.local/src/superpowers/`) as real-world test data — it ships skills, hooks, and four provider plugins (Claude, Cursor, Codex, Gemini), so every layer has a concrete case to validate against.

Each artifact is written incrementally, with redirection between steps. The point is to discover where the layering is wrong, not to produce a finished spec on the first pass.
